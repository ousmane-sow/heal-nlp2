We will make data from our trial available for other researchers by uploading it to the National Clinical TrialsDatabase. The proposed research will include data from 1,170 primary care patients diagnosed with opioid usedisorder and a psychiatric disorder. It will also include data from 150 primary care practice staff working withthem. The final dataset will include quantitative (socio-demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics,outcomes intervention fidelity) data. We will collect identifiers required to create a Global Unique Identifier(GUID) that will allow for inclusions in the National Database of Clinical Trials. We also will includerecommended language in our consent forms related to obtain participant permission to upload their data tothe National Database. Our budget includes PI and data manager time to format and upload the data. Thedescriptive data will be uploaded every six months during data collection periods of the study. All other data willbe submitted at time of the publication of the manuscripts describing our main findingsThe information and materials arising from this work are covered by patents and other types of intellectual property (IP) protection and will be handled accordingly.
