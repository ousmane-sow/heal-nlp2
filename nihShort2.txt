
We will comply with all NIH HEAL Initiative Resource and Data Sharing policies established during the project period  A data repository will be set up by NIH for all HEAL Initiative projects and all data and resources  as outlined below  will be shared to the designated NIH HEAL repository  The NIH HCS Research Collaboratory Program has established a Collaboratory Coordinating Center to provide technical expertise in embedded pragmatic trials in health care systems  In accordance with NIH Collaboratory policies  we will prepare the primary analysis datasets  at a minimum  for submission to the Collaboratory Coordinating Center  In accordance with ICJME policies  we will prepare the primary analysis datasets for review and reproducibility by peer reviewed journals  We will prepare the final datasets and accompanying resource documents for final deposit to the designated NIH HEAL data repository  
We will use the Data and or Materials only as outlined by the NIH HEAL Initiative  in a manner that is consistent with applicable state and federal laws and regulations  including any informed consent requirements and the terms of the institution s NIH funding  including 
The results will be made public in multiple ways  
Regular presentations at national and international scientific meetings  We will present  in abstract form  at least once per year  and the PIs will also present the data in invited talks  seminars  and workshops  
All data will be analyzed and published in peer reviewed literature  Means  standard deviations  sample sizes will always be published  
Publication of datasets and resources  We will make available publicly any provider and patient educational materials to facilitate widespread implementation of the intervention as outlined in detail below  The datasets and accompanying resources will be made available to the designated NIH HEAL data repository according to the NIH Collaboratory program policies  
Resource Sharing  As part of the NIH Collaboratory we will share resources including the Protocol  Informed 
Consent template  Manual of Procedures  Statistical Analysis Plan  Data Dictionary  Annotated Case report Forms 
 CRFs   CRF Mapping Spreadsheet  and ReadMe files  These will be posted to a central study website managed by 
the NIH Collaboratory Coordinating Center that is publicly available and made available upon request 
Data Sharing  The current study is expected to generate patient reported outcomes for individuals with fibromyalgia across a broad spectrum of domains  pain  fatigue  function  psychological factors  and quality of life  We will also collect some data from the electronic health record about number of physical therapy visits  CPT codes for treatments  and the patient specific functional scale  In addition  we will have TENS usage data downloaded from the TENS devices that will show the number of minutes of TENS use and the number of 30 minute sessions completed  Data will be collected prior to the intervention  baseline data  and 30  60  90 and 180 days after enrollment  
Lastly  we will collect data from 24 clinics across 5 healthcare systems  Data regarding usage of physical therapy services  billing codes  treatment patterns of care for those with fibromyalgia for a given clinic or healthcare population could be used inappropriately to compare clinics or healthcare systems and could reveal proprietary health systems business information  Therefore  patient level data will be deidentified and stored in aggregate  Identifiers for healthcare system and patients will be removed  
Analysis datasets will be made available at the time of publication of the primary manuscript  Complete datasets and 

accompanying resources will be deposited to the designated NIH HEAL initiative data repository after the completion of the primary aim manuscript  
Publications will be made available to the public using open access publishing  so they become available immediately to the public  All publications will be accessible through PubMED  google scholar  and available to the public through open access  
A final close out checklist for data and resource sharing developed by the NIH Collaboratory Coordinating Center will be used and maintained by the study team in consultation with the NIH Collaboratory Coordinating Center
A primary goal of the OBOE Study Consortium is to facilitate discoveries by the broad scientific community  RTI realizes data sharing is an important way to increase the ability of researchers  scientists  and policy makers to analyze and translate data into meaningful reports and knowledge  The data collected through the OBOE Study are expected to provide a wealth of information regarding impacts of antenatal opioid exposure and NOWs with the expectation that these study results could potentially lead to intervention studies to improve outcomes for these vulnerable infants  The plan for sharing the study data and the potential for an imaging repository demand carefully developed strategies that are cognizant of the importance of protecting participants  rights to individual privacy and are compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996  HIPAA  regulations  NIH requirements  and the Consortium policies and procedures  We have collaborated with NICHD to establish data sharing plans for previous studies  and we propose to follow those best practices for this study  For data sharing to conform to the strictest standards of data protection  one or both of the following approaches may be considered  
The Consortium s informed consent form must contain language informing parents that their and their child s data will be put into a database consisting of information from all the participants in the study and that data may be shared with other Consortium investigators  the study sponsor  and applicable federal agencies and may be shared for future research under the NIH Public Access Policy  
After the study is completed  data for the entire study may be stripped of identifying information and may be shared with outside researchers including  for instance  submitting de identified data to the NICHD Data and Specimen Hub  DASH   MRI images shared through the neuroimaging core at Children s National Medical Center s XNAT platform  or other public databases in compliance with the NIH Public Access Policy  
Approval of requests for data and other study materials will be contingent on the OBOE Study SC approval and compliance with  1  NICHD data sharing policies   2  relevant local  state  and federal laws  such as those regarding intellectual property  and  3  the Certificate of Confidentiality  
Measures to Protect Patient Confidentiality 
The OBOE Study Consortium will take great care to ensure that participant confidentiality is maintained in all shared data  Shared data can be aggregated at the individual study center level  aggregated as microdata with no identifiers  or aggregated as micro data with one or more identifiers  Data may also be shared at several levels  with investigators at our Clinical Sites and with outside investigators  Each level of aggregating and sharing data carries its own level of disclosure risk  The DCC will work with the OBOE SC to develop a data sharing plan that will strike a balance between the protection of participants  rights and the desire for scientific collaboration  The plan will address the following issues  the expected disclosure risk level for each type of data sharing  which data types can be shared  the types of people  within the study or outside the study  who can access data at various levels  the form of participant parental informed consent required for each level of data sharing  and procedures for review and approval of data access request applications  
Public Use Datasets 
We will comply with the NIH requirements for sharing data through the creation of public use datasets  We will follow established procedures to ensure that publicly released data satisfy all HIPAA and any related requirements for protecting participant identity  including the following  
Replacing the unique participant identification variable in the original datasets with a new unique participant identifier produced by a random number generator  
Removing any personal information from the dataset  much of this type of data is not included in the data submitted to the DCC by the Clinical Sites   
Removing or recoding other distinguishing parameters  such as dates  research site identification numbers  and hospitals where medical procedures were performed  For example  dates can be recoded relative to a participant specific reference point  and specific locations can be replaced by more general geographic codes  
Combining subgroups with low frequencies or truncating distributions to ensure that there are a minimum number of participants for each category or value within each gender ethnicity cell  
In collaboration with the OBOE SC  the DCC will develop a data management plan that addresses final data documentation and archival considerations from the beginning of the project  We will follow current best practices for creating  maintaining  and documenting all OBOE Study datasets to ensure preservation of accurate and usable data and metadata  while protecting the privacy of the study participants  
Data Sharing Using the NICHD Data and Specimen Hub  N DASH  
N DASH provides a centralized resource for investigators to share and access data from NICHD funded research  The submission of OBOE Study data to N DASH will help N DASH achieve the goal of being a one  stop shop for researchers interested in performing secondary analyses using data generated by NICHD projects  
The DCC for the OBOE Consortium has fully engaged in data submission to N DASH and has defined processes and procedures for de identifying the data  providing Institutional Certifications  compiling required documentation files  entering descriptive study information and summary statistics on study participant characteristics  and submitting materials through the dashboard  and they will be able to draw on the expertise and experience of other RTI DCC staff as necessary to complete the OBOE Study submission as needed  With approval from the OBOE SC  the DCC will follow these steps for submission to DASH  
Data De identification  Following the DASH de identification guidance  the DCC proposes to create new study ID numbers  scramble site ID numbers  and retain birth years with all dates changed to day of life or day of study by the primary study statistician  Datasets will not include any data that meet specific criteria that might allow the participant to be identified  including but not limited to  1  cells for categorical measures with less than 5  prevalence   2  individual continuous measures that lie more than 4 standard deviations from the median  or  3  any variable considered to be a unique identifier  Before submission  the OBOE SC will determine and the DCC will document exceptions reasons for not including specific variables  These de identified data and associated documents will be reviewed by the OBOE SC before submission to DASH  Additionally  an overview document will be provided to RTI s Data Security Officer and the sIRB to ensure our proposed processes are sufficient to fully protect the confidentiality of study participants  
Documentation  Final documentation for de identified versions of the public use datasets will include annotated CRFs for clinical datasets  derived variable specifications for analysis datasets  data dictionaries for all datasets  and programs and documentation created during harmonization processes  including mappings between clinical and harmonized variables and descriptions of any discrepancies between the public use datasets and published manuscript  Once the public use files have been prepared  we will share submission with the OBOE SC and the NICHD Program Scientist  Upon their approval  the materials will be submitted to N DASH no later than the acceptance for publication of the main findings from the final dataset  Submissions will include additional documents required by N DASH  including the study protocol  
Sharing Imaging Data Using Children s National Medical Center s XNAT Platform 
XNAT is an open source imaging informatics software platform with core functions that manage imports  archives  and processes and securely distributes imaging and related study data  Through XNAT the OBOE Consortium can create a centralized public imaging data resource  
XNAT includes an online image viewer that supports common neuroimaging formats  including DICOM and Analyze  XNAT uses quality control procedures that will allow for the level of data de identification described above for archived MRI images  Data can be entered into the archive as XML or through data entry forms  User access is provided via secure web application  With OBOE Study images archived in XNAT  long term integrity of the data is maintained and can be shared with the broader neuroimaging community when approved by the OBOE Study SC  
Genomic Data Sharing 
Genomic and pharmacogenomic studies are not part of the Specific Aims of the OBOE Study proposal  However  if genomic and pharmacogenomic secondary studies for participants in this study are added to the protocol  the OBOE Consortium will comply with NIH requirements for sharing genomic data  
Sharing Model Organisms 
Not applicable  
Sharing Research Resources 
The only sharable resource the OBOE Study Consortium anticipates generating for this research study is the data and MRI images from the study  
Data Sharing Plan
The Wake Forest NCORP Research Base  WF NCORP RB  will fully adhere to the data sharing goals  policies  and timelines defined by the NIH and will follow the NIH guidelines for publications by assisting in and assuring submission to a PubMed Central indexed venue or depositing peer reviewed full manuscripts into the NIH Manuscript Submission system  NIHMS   

Data Sharing The WF NCORP RB believes that data sharing and exchange stimulates the development of new and novel approaches in cancer control and cancer delivery research studies and is committed to following the NIH Statement on Sharing Research Data   The primary means of data sharing and dissemination is typically through scientific publications and presentations so we are committed to presenting and publishing results of all studies in a timely manner   Additionally  we have links on the WF NCORP RB website to all publications where available  Previously  the WF NCORP RB would share de identified raw data upon request  As of July 2018  the WF NCORP RB signed an agreement with NCI to contribute de identified data and data dictionaries from clinical trials conducted through our RB to the NCI NCTN NCORP data archive within 6 months of primary and non primary publications of phase II III and phase III trials to This will become the primary means for sharing raw data  and we will adhere to the guidelines spelled out in the NCTN NCORP Data Archive Usage Guide   De identified raw data from studies that are not covered by the agreement  e g   phase II and observational studies  will still be made available upon request  Ensuring patient privacy and confidentiality will be of primary importance in creating files to be shared  All data files will be de identified  that is data intended for sharing will be stripped of all variables considered personal health identifiers by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  HIPAA    In addition  variables that could permit linkages to individual research participants and variables that could lead to deductive disclosure of the identity of individual subjects will be removed or recoded  De identification procedures will meet the HIPAA criteria as detailed in the Code of Federal Regulations  Part 45  Section

Genomics Data Sharing including Genome Wide Association Studies  GWAS   Any studies in which WF NCORP RB generates research data from genomics will be shared according to the specified timelines and methods requested by the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy  available  which is built on top of the Data Sharing Policy for GWAS  The WF NCORP RB will deposit genome sequencing  SNPs  and expression profiling data as described in the policies

Products of the Research Type of Data  
The data generated from the proposed work will include engineering  device designs  computational modeling  performance data  and in vitro and in vivo preclinical performance and pathology data to support a thermal nerve block device 
Data Format and Standards 
There are no specific data collection standards for a medical device supporting thermal nerve block  All data will be recorded in the laboratory notebooks and files of the PI  co investigator  and laboratory personnel  The PI will have final responsibility for managing  collecting and evaluating the data and materials generated from this project  including those generated by Dr  Tai at the University of Pittsburgh 
Access to Data and Data Sharing Practices and Policies 
All proprietary and recorded data will be sequestered for the duration of the project by the company  In the event that data  methodology  processes  or devices developed during the course of work are considered potentially commercially valuable  we will seek to protect the information through a provisional patent within 3   6 months of discovery  if not already protected  All inventions and patents will be reported through iEdison as required  
Intellectual property considerations will not prevent us from sharing the results of this work with the research community in general  Once protected  we will disseminate key findings promptly to the scientific community by publication in conference proceedings  presentations at scientific meetings  and publication in peer reviewed journals 
Researchers interested in utilizing our device and system will be provided access through a Research Use Only agreement  once intellectual property has been protected  Thermaquil Inc  and the University of Pittsburgh reserve the right to use these materials and data for educational  research  or other non business purposes 
Policies for use  distribution and derivatives
The results from this proposal will be promptly prepared and submitted for publication where appropriate  with authorship ownership that accurately reflects the contributions of those involved with the research  We will share non proprietary information  such as the primary data  samples  electronic files  and other supporting materials created or gathered during the course of this work  with other researchers at no more than incremental cost and within a reasonable time  ~6 months of completing the project   We will encourage and facilitate such sharing  Privileged or confidential information will be released only in a form that protects the privacy of individuals involved 
Archiving of Data
All data generated during this project will be archived for a period of at least 7 years  All released data and intellectual property will remain the property of the company  and will be managed by the CEO  Departure of any key personnel from this project  or from the company  will not jeopardize access or retention of these data or materials 

We are committed to making available to the public the results and accomplishments of the activities of this project in accordance with the NIH Data Sharing Policy from the NIH Collaboratory Coordinating Center  We expect to generate data from sickle cell patients  who are primarily Black African American and from low socioeconomic status  We plan to achieve our data sharing goals in a number of ways  
We are committed to implementing the NIH Health Care Systems Research Collaboratory Data Sharing Policy  
The Collaboratory investigators will each share  at a minimum  a final research data set upon which the primary pragmatic trial publication is based  
Sharing data derived from clinical care in studies performed in partnership with health care systems may  under some situations  require precautions in addition to those regarding patient confidentiality  to protect specific interests of collaborating health care systems  facilities or providers  
Consistent with NIH policy and guidance  the Collaboratory investigators will choose the least restrictive method for sharing of research data that provides appropriate protection for participant privacy  health system privacy  and scientific integrity  
The Collaboratory investigators will work with NIH to implement this data sharing policy  to ensure the appropriate administrative processes and technical infra  structure are in place to support timely data sharing for the Collaboratory  
We will adhere to the following key points of the NIH Data Sharing Policy  
This Policy applies to all human data in the NIH IRP  including the NIH Clinical Center as well as NIH Institutes and Centers  
A Data Sharing Plan must be developed for any research involving human data  
Data Sharing Plans will be included in the institute scientific review process for research involving human data  
The Institute Scientific Director  SD  or their designee is responsible for approving all Data Sharing Plans  
All IRP supported clinical investigators are expected to develop protocols and consent processes forms to enable broad data sharing for secondary research consistent with this Policy  
Sharing data for secondary research purposes shall comply with human subjects research regulations and procedures  if applicable  
All IRP investigators are encouraged to deposit data in publicly accessible research repositories for sharing to the extent feasible and appropriate  
This Policy is effective as of October 1  2015  Any intramural research involving human data undergoing scientific review after October 1  2015 must have a data sharing plan
Direct Sharing of Primary Data 
The final data set will include self reported demographics and behavioral data from self report questionnaires  and interviews  The final data set will be stripped of individual identifiers prior to release for sharing  Underlying Primary Data will be de identified according to the standards set forth in the HHS Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects to ensure that the identities of research subjects cannot be readily ascertained with the data  Underlying Primary Data will be stripped of identifiers according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  HIPAA  Privacy Rule  Participants will be notified prior to providing their informed consent that de identified study data will be shared  
The data and associated documentation will be made available to users only under a data sharing agreement that provides for  a  a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual patient   b  a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology  and  c  a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed  Such a data use agreement will be executed through the PIs and the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Nursing  The database can then be accessed via our secure website  in a format that can be used by a variety of statistical software packages  We will make our data and results publicly available  predominately online   so that they can easily be found  
Indirect Data Sharing Plan 
We will publish our results in open source manuscripts that will be available to the public  Electronic copies of publications will be deposited in PubMed Central with proper tagging of metadata to ensure online discoverability and accessibility within four weeks of acceptance by a journal  Publications will be published under the Creative Commons Attribution Generic License or an equivalent license  or otherwise dedicated to the public domain  e g   Creative Commons public domain tool  To the extent feasible  Underlying Primary Data will be shared simultaneously with the publication and made immediately accessible through release under the Creative Commons Attribution 4 0 Generic License or an equivalent license  or otherwise dedicated to the public domain  Creative Commons public domain tool  CC0   Before submitting Underlying Primary Data  we will work with our Institutional Review Board  IRB  and Data Safety and Monitoring Board to assess the informed consent materials and to determine whether the Underlying Primary Data may be shared as contemplated in this policy  For more ways we will indirectly share our data please see our dissemination plan 
DATA SHARING PLAN 
The proposed research will involve a sample  60 subjects  recruited from the Boulder  CO and surrounding area with chronic lower back pain  There are two primary sets of data being collected  1  outcome measures related to AIM 1 pain intensity and QoL   and 2  outcome measures related to AIM 2  fMRI data   
AIM 1 Data  This data is specific to the proprietary VRNT product  so  use of the participant  level data sets in other research has limited value  The data is also proprietary  
AIM 2 Data  Anonymized fMRI data will be shared on data open science repositories  In addition  the University of Colorado team have developed several open source software packages in Matlab and Python for performing some of the proposed analyses that are available on github  a cloud based code sharing repository 
Data Sharing Plan 
Policies and Timing 
After last subject enrollment and all follow up procedures have been completed  the HEAL Pain Management Effectiveness Research Network Data Coordinating Center  DCC  at the University of Utah will prepare a final study database for the trial  which will then be used for statistical analyses and publication of findings from the trial  
The Trial will provide a very rich resource of data concerning methods for managing pain and reducing opioid addiction  and the DCC will produce a database that can be used by non ERN investigators  The policies for release of this database will be determined by the NIH   These policies are expected to focus primarily on the timing of data release  Our preliminary plan is to release the database  defined below  at the time of publication of the primary manuscript  or within 12 months of last patient procedure  whichever comes first   Implementation of the plan will follow the HEAL Public Access and Data Sharing Policy as outlined at
Releasable Database 
A releasable database will be produced and will be completely de identified in accordance with the definitions provided in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  HIPAA   Namely  all identifiers specified in HIPAA will be recoded in a manner that will make it impossible to deduce or impute the specific identity of any patient  The database will not contain any institutional identifiers  
The DCC will also prepare a data dictionary that provides a concise definition of every data element included in the database  If specific data elements have idiosyncrasies that might affect interpretation or analysis  this will be discussed in the dictionary document  Data elements that are considered unreliable will be deleted  and this will be noted in the documentation 
In accordance with policies of the NIH  the DCC will send the releasable database to the entity determined by the NIH or specific institute to be the repository for data created under the HEAL initiative   The DCC is able to produce a relational database export  or use SAS or SPSS data sets   The DCC will accompany the database with full documentation so that individual investigators will be able to effectively use the data 
Access to Data 
Access to the releasable database housed in the NIH assigned repository will be in accordance with procedures and regulations of the NIH or specific institute   The DCC will not provide any support for investigators using the releasable database 
On June 29th we met with HEAL Data Stewards during office hours to discuss the Data Asset Inventory  We explained that it was difficult to answer many of these questions because our HEAL award is a supplement to a pre existing award and did not require a Public Access or Data Sharing Plan  The HEAL Data Stewards recommended that we select  Not Sure  as responses to items without a clear answer and to submit this paragraph describing our conversation  They planned to discuss how to handle data sharing for supplements with HEAL program administrators and report back to the Project Manager  
Data Sharing Plan 
Sharing of data generated by this project will be an essential part of the EPPIC Network activities and will be carried out in several different ways  We expect that the results from the EPPIC Network studies will be made available to the community of scientists interested in the treatment of chronic pain and in the identification of biomarkers for specific pain syndromes and potentially treatment response  As a member of the EPPIC network we would welcome collaboration with others who are interested in extending the results of our clinical studies  
In our role as a Specialized Clinical Center  our plan will include the following  
Presentations at national scientific meetings and publications  It is expected that presentations of specific results will be made at national meetings and through publications as appropriate  As in any network  there will need to be a process for deciding who will take primary responsibility for the write up and presentation of the research and what role the overall group of investigators will play in the process  This process will need to be presented and discussed an early face to face meeting of the network with the assumption that there will be appointment of a publication committee to consider proposals from the network investigators to access  analyze  write up  present  and publish interesting findings  It is expected that the investigators from the EPPIC Network will be active participants of the creation of this sub group  
Newsletter  It is expected that the Data Coordinating Center DCC  and Clinical Coordinating Center CCC  will have the primary role for communication between the Specialized Clinical Centers SCC  which will happen primarily via e mail but might benefit from a regular newsletter format to report on progress  problems  solutions etc  
Sharing of the Clinical Trial Data  It is the responsibility of the SCCs to upload data to the DCC and respond to queries to ensure high quality data  Upon completion of the data collection  analysis  interpretation and initial publication of the results of any clinical trial  it will be the responsibility of the DCC or CCC to upload the data in an appropriate format to the NIH Repository and share the data with any reasonable request from other researcher  The SCCs will assist as needed but are not expected to primarily share the full data sets  
Data Sharing Plan 
The proposed research will include data from approximately 280 total subjects consisting of young adults ages presenting for treatment with Opioid Use Disorder  The final dataset will include self reported demographic and behavioral data from interviews with the subjects and laboratory data from urine specimens provided  as well as treatment utilization data gleaned from their health care providers  It will also include qualitative data from a subset of the participants  whose exact nature is somewhat unpredictable  given open ended interviewing formats  In particular  we will be collecting information throughout the dataset about highly sensitive information including illegal drug use and other criminal activity  
Even though the final dataset will be deidentified prior to release for sharing  we believe that there remains the possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects with unusual characteristics  Thus  we will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data sharing agreement that provides for  a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant  a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology and other sufficient security procedures  and a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed  
We will strictly adhere to the NIH Grant Policy on Sharing of Unique Research Resources including the Sharing of Biomedical Research Resources Principles and Guidelines for Recipients of NIH Grants and Contracts issued in December 1999 We will make reagents developed under this proposal available to our colleagues upon request  except in the instance when sharing such materials  or associated information  could negatively the protection of new intellectual property  Any clones packaged virus or stable cell lines generated to support the aims of this project will be distributed freely and will be made available to the broader research community either before or immediately after publication of manuscripts  We will provide relevant protocols or other requested reagents upon request  All published data will be published in peer reviewed journals and large datasets will be deposited into appropriate publicly accessible repositories 
Sharing of data generated by this project is an essential part of our proposed activities and will be carried out in several different ways  The Persist Study wishes to make our results available both to the community of scientists interested in substance use  chronic pain  and medication assisted treatment  Conversely  we would welcome collaboration with others who could make use of the assessment protocols developed in the Persist Study 

Our plan includes the following 

What data will be shared 
The Persist Study will share quantitative data collected during all study time points  baseline and follow up assessments   This data includes demographics  substance use history  buprenorphine treatment history  and history with chronic pain  This data will be deposited at which are NIH suggested repositories 

Who will have access to the data 
The Persist Study agrees that data will be deposited and made available through which are NIH suggested repositories  and that these data will be shared with investigators working under an institution with a Federal Wide Assurance  FWA  and could be used for secondary study purposes such as comparing pain functioning to medication retention   The Persist Study agrees that the names and Institutions of persons either given or denied access to the data  and the bases for such decisions  will be summarized in the annual progress report   Meta analysis data and associated data  along with data content  format  and organization  will be made available to investigators through 

Where will the data be shared  The Persist Study agrees to deposit and maintain the data  and secondary analysis of data  if any  at  which are NIH suggested repositories and that these repositories have data access policies and procedures consistent with NIH data sharing policies 

When will the data be shared  
The Persist Study agrees to deposit outcome data into  repositories as soon as possible but no later than within one year of the completion of the funded project period for the parent award or upon acceptance of the data for publication  or public disclosure of a submitted patent application  whichever is earlier 

How will researchers locate and access the data 
The Persist Study agrees to identify where the data will be available and how to access the data in any publications and presentations that Principle Investigators  Mark Ilgen and Allison Lin  author or co author about these data  as well as acknowledge the repository and funding source in any publications and presentations   As our project will be using which are NIH suggested repositories  these repositories have policies and procedures in place that will provide data access to qualified researchers  fully consistent with NIH data sharing policies and applicable laws and regulations 

The sharing of data generated through this project Injectable naltrexone 2 month depot formulations is an essential part of the proposed activities as the project reaches the proposed milestones   With the goal of this project to develop a product for the treatment of opioid dependence  every effort will be utilized to disseminate the data in an attempt to transform the research and technology developments of PLGA based systems into future usable products and life saving measures   We aim to disseminate the data through several outlets to the community of scientists  doctors  and patients interested in the treatment of opioid dependence and also the prevention of overdose   Additionally  we are openly welcome to collaboration with others who can aid in the development or use the sustained release formulation technologies developed in this project  

Our plan includes 

Posters Presentations at international scientific meetings   From the project  we envision that at least once annually a poster presentation will be appropriate   The Controlled Release Society annual meeting  of which the PI was a program chair for 2016  is an excellent opportunity to present the data   This 4 day meeting presents information on a variety of controlled release drug delivery systems   

Scientific Manuscripts   It is expected that at least one scientific manuscript will result from the project each year and the data will be published in a representative journal  such as Pharmaceutical Research    In addition  all final peer reviewed manuscripts resulting from data generated from this project will be submitted to the digital archive PubMed Central  
 
Focused Groups and Websites  A number of focus groups and websites exist for the treatment of substance abuse  specifically opioids due to the current epidemic   Summaries of research findings will be submitted to the websites  geared for a general audience  in an effort to provide the information to the population outside the scientific community 
Data Dissemination Plan 
The New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University are committed to the open and timely dissemination of research outcomes  We understand that promising new methods  technologies  data  and insights may arise during the course of our research  We are aware of and agree to abide by the principles for sharing research resources  as described by NIH in the  NIH Policy on the Dissemination of NIH Funded Clinical Trial Information   Accordingly  the studies proposed in the current application will be registered and maintained on ClinicalTrials gov  and upon conclusion of the study  the results will be reported to and available on this site  Data will also be shared via posters or talks at international academic conferences  such as the College on Problems of Drug Dependence  CPDD  and the International Narcotics Research Conference  INRC   Research manuscripts reporting the findings from the specific aims outlined in this proposal will be submitted for publication in peer reviewed journals  We feel this constitutes an acceptable mechanism for disseminating our results
Opioid use disorders  OUD  are among the most severe and deadly substance use disorders  SUD  in young people  Psychiatric disorders pose one of the major risks to develop opioid and other SUDs  For instance  young people with psychopathology are at two to three fold increased risk to develop nicotine  alcohol  opioid and drug use disorders  Reciprocally  very high rates of psychopathology have been reported in samples of young people with OUD and other SUDs  This is particularly important since up to three quarters of psychiatric and SUDs onset in childhood or young adulthood  Despite psychopathology robustly increasing the risk for later substance related disorders  remarkably little has been completed examining the impact of treating psychopathology on reducing rates of OUD  nicotine and other SUDs  Given the common prevalence of juvenile psychopathology  and the high morbidity and mortality associated with OUD and other SUDs  identification of substance use and psychopathology as well as elucidating the longer term impacts  and intervening relationships  of treatment of psychopathology on OUD  nicotine and other SUDs in behavioral health and substance use settings in young people is of the highest clinical and public health utility  
Study Design Overview  New and existing patients in the outpatient behavioral health and SUD clinics at Massachusetts General Hospital  MGH  and Boston Medical Center  BMC  who are ages 16 to 30 years and do not have an OUD  will be recruited to evaluate the impact of treatment of psychopathology with symptom monitoring through patient related outcome measures  PROMs  on the development of an OUD  nicotine and other SUDs  PROMs will be implemented in behavioral health clinics and integrated into the electronic medical record to systematically assess patient participant self report of psychiatric symptoms and substance use at baseline and longitudinally  Using identical methodology  we will also be evaluating the effect of dual diagnosis treatment with non OUD SUD to examine if treatment mitigates the onset of OUD  In addition to PROMs  information regarding treatment  psychological characteristics  substance use  social environment  and quality adjusted life years will be collected to assess research outcomes  PROMs will allow patient participants and clinicians to use validated measurements to evaluate an individual s response to treatment that can be feasibly implemented into young persons  behavioral and SUD health care  At the end of the study propensity score matching will be used to evaluate the effect of treatment of psychopathology on the development of OUD  nicotine and other SUDs  Data derived from this study will help inform clinical guidelines  public health policy  and provide important secondary outcomes for further work on the prevention of OUD  nicotine and SUD in relation to early onset psychopathology

2  Powerandstatisticalanalysisplan 
Aim I    All transcripts of focus groups and individual interviews will be independently coded by two trained research assistants using NVivo software and an a priori developed codebook  The RE AIM framework and CFIR constructs will be used to evaluate barriers and facilitators to PROMS implementation  Additionally  we will calculate the percentage of new and existing patient participants who completed PROMs  the percentage of patient participants who complete PROMs during follow  up  and the percentage of providers who view and document PROMs  We will also calculate the percentage of patients with S2BI TAPS positive screens  
Aims II  III  & IV  Because this is a study involving well documented treatment methods for psychiatric disorders  it would be unethical to withhold treatment from participants and therefore we cannot randomize treatment during enrollment  Furthermore  we expect treatment status to change throughout the study  so defining treatment groups at enrollment would not capture true treatment patterns over the course of the trial  Therefore  we will categorize patients as having high versus low treatment exposure at the end of the study using a definition similar to the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD  We will define treatment exposure  50  of the study period as high treatment exposure  <50  as low treatment exposure  
Given this quasi experimental design  we consider two potential methods for analysis that account for the fact that treatment allocation was not randomly assigned  The first method is a mixed effects regression model adjusted for potential confounders using propensity scores  This method utilizes the complete dataset and is robust against outliers  However  it requires many assumptions and does not guarantee that the treatment groups will be sufficiently balanced for potential confounders  The second method is a treatment effects model with propensity score matching  This method requires fewer assumptions  allows us to evaluate the similarity of the treated and untreated groups  creates comparable groups using information that is independent from the outcome  allows us to directly examine the balance of characteristics in the matched sample  and  as with regression adjustment  is robust against outliers  However  the method has some limitations which include possibly using a partial dataset  if matches cannot be found  and not being able to use a longitudinal analysis framework  To deal with the strengths and weaknesses of these methods  we will use the treatment effects model as our primary method and conduct a sensitivity analysis using a mixed effects regression model adjusting for propensity scores  If we lose too many cases due to not enough matches  we will perform an additional sensitivity analysis using a treatment effects model with augmented inverse probability weighting  This method uses the whole dataset but is not robust to outliers  
Treatment effects models with propensity matching require identifying predictors of treatment to calculate a propensity score  Within the treatment effects model framework  we will use logistic regression models to predict the propensity for receiving treatment using the following covariates  the 

severity of the primary psychiatric diagnosis  the number of comorbid conditions  overall symptom burden  functional impairment  age  sex  social class  and insurance status  Once propensity scores are calculated  treated participants will be matched to untreated participants using 1 1 matching or n 1 matching if the distribution allows  The treatment effect on the outcome will then be analyzed in the matched sample  All analyses will be performed using Stata 
Aim II  Given that this is a naturalistic study  we do not know what the groups will look like but anticipate getting more treated versus untreated participants  If the distribution of patient participants allows  we will be able to employ n 1 matching  However  since this is unknown  we will compute power based on the assumption of 1 1 matching  Additionally  because power analysis methods are not available for this complex model  we will estimate using traditional methods for generalized linear models with a binomial distribution and logit link function  In 2018  we had approximately 4 300 existing patients in our Behavioral Health Clinics and we receive about 1 300 new evaluations per year  Given our existing pool of patients plus two years of new evaluations to account for study implementation and recruitment  we will have about 6 900 potential participants  Assuming a 50  enrollment rate and a 15  dropout rate  we anticipate enrolling 3 450 patient participants and expect to have 2 932 participants left at the end of the study  To make our calculations  we need to specify the prevalence of SUD in treated and untreated patients  While our study sample will comprise of participants with many different psychopathologies  we will base the prevalence of SUD on the subsample of patients with ADHD because the most extensive research has been done on SUD in this population  In a prospective study of males with ADHD  Biederman et al  showed SUD prevalence of 75  in the non medicated ADHD group and 25  in the medicated ADHD group at the four year follow up  Similarly  in a prospective study of females with ADHD  Wilens et al  showed SUD prevalence of 48  in the non stimulant therapy group and 21  in the stimulant therapy group at the four year follow up  Since the prevalence in the medicated groups differ by about 25  between males and females  we will use the rates from Wilens et al  in our power calculations to be conservative  Assuming SUD prevalence of 21  in the treated group and 48  in the untreated group  standard deviation of 3 168  sample size of 2 932  1 466 per group   and alpha 0 017 to account for the three statistical tests in Aim 2  we will have 80  power to detect an odds ratio  OR  1 31  90  power to detect an OR 1 35  where the ORs are the odds of the untreated group developing OUD compared to the treated group  
Aim III  Again  we will estimate power for this aim using traditional methods for generalized linear models with a binomial distribution and logit link function  In 2018  we had approximately 360 existing patients in our SUD Treatment Clinics and we receive about 400 new evaluations per year  Given our existing pool of patients plus two years of new evaluations to account for study implementation and recruitment  we will have about 1 160 potential participants  Assuming a 50  enrollment rate and a 15  dropout rate  we anticipate enrolling 580 participants and expect to have 492 participants left at the end of the study  The literature on the prevalence of OUD in patients with existing SUD who are being treated for juvenile psychopathology is sparse  The prevalence is a key piece of information we need to make power calculations  Based on observation of unintentional OD in our own outpatient SUD treatment program  when we examined rates of OD in patients 1 5 years prior to intake and after 1 5 years of treatment  we saw a 50  reduction in rate of OD  18  vs  9   respectively  Given that most of the ODs were opioid related  we will use this 50  reduction as a proxy for the difference in prevalence of OUD in SUD patients who are and are not being treated for psychopathology  In Table 1 in Appendix B we present the minimum detectable effect using a sample size of 492  246 per group   an alpha 0 025 to account for the two statistical tests in Aim 3  and power of 80  and 90  for various OUD prevalence that differ by 50  in the treated and untreated groups  ORs are the odds of the untreated group developing OUD compared to the treated group  
Aim IV  Key analyses for this aim involving mediation will all be done fully prospectively  i e   treatment predictor at T1  followed by mediator at T2  and outcome at T3   The variables whose 
effects are to be mediated will be degree of treatment exposure measured at T1  The analyses will replicate common practice in mediation mechanisms research  The mediational analyses of OUD SUD outcomes will use hierarchical linear modeling  HLM   covarying for any baseline opioid substance use and prior treatment  Each mediator will initially be tested individually by itself  The significance of mediation effects will be tested by a product of coefficients test using bootstrapped standard errors  Once a proposed mediator  such as subjective distress or psychiatric symptom reduction  has been established to work in isolation  it will be tested in combination with all significant mediators  i e   multiple mediation model  to help determine the relative importance of each mediator in explaining any observed effect of treatment on reducing OUD SUD risks  while accounting for all other significant mediators  For the moderators  demographics  psychosocial  clinical  we will examine the effect of duration and intensity of treatment adding one moderator at a time to the model to test how treatments  effects on reducing OUD SUD risks may be potentiated or attenuated by each specific moderator variable  For moderation effects  we will report statistical significance  if present  but also effect sizes  Where significant moderation is detected  follow up analyses will clarify directionality  Furthermore  we will attempt to unpack significant primary findings to generate concrete applications for use in clinical practice  Potential examples include  1  generating specific cut off scores suggesting a patient would particularly benefit  or not  for a given mechanism  2  sensitivity analyses to determine the duration and or intensity of treatment associated with positive effects  and 3  applying evidence based medicine concepts such as of  number needed to treat  to inform practice and compare with other interventions
Target population distribution 
Projected Cumulative Enrollment 
Efforts will be made to attain a mix of study participants  in terms of gender and racial ethnic representation  that is reflective of the respective populations under study  No restrictions are placed on recruiting related to sex or ethnicity of subjects  All subjects  regardless of sex  race  or ethnicity who meet the eligibility requirements will be permitted to enter the study  No ethnic or racial group will be excluded from this study  We expect the racial ethnic composition of the sample will mirror that of the Boston area  We will not exclude subjects on the basis of gender  We expect approximately 50  of subjects will be female  Approximately 15 to 20 percent of the population belongs to minority ethnic racial groups  Although the subsample of minorities will not yield enough statistical power for tests of our hypotheses within minorities  we will examine the minority data separately to generate hypotheses for future work  
4  Protectionofdataandqualityassurance completeness
Data will be collected by trained research coordinators who have completed on line training in human subjects research  HIPAA  research integrity  training in our lab on research data management and confidentiality  and project protocol procedures  
To ensure confidentiality  all raw data generated in this study will be filed in special research files  one per participant  which will be identified only by an ID number that will not identify the participant in any way  Any material including the names of participants or other identifying information  consent assent forms  paper records  will be kept in locked filing cabinets in a locked room  Documentation linking participant s names and numbers will be kept in a password protected electronic file only accessible by the project coordinator and primary investigators  PIs  on a password protected computer located behind a secure and maintained firewall  
Digital audio recordings will be transferred to a password protected secure storage drive and the Research Coordinators will remove any identifying information  De identified recordings will then be sent for transcription to a HIPAA compliant transcription service  Following their transcription  voice recordings will be deleted from the audio recorder and storage drive  
Transcripts and behavioral notes from focus groups  individual interviews  and usability testing will be double checked to ensure that they do not contain any identifying information  The notes and transcripts will be stored in a password protected word document on a secure computer server  to which access will only be granted to members of the study team  If notes are originally written by hand they will be stored in a locked office for a maximum of one week before being transcribed into the word document  After transcription  handwritten notes will be shredded  
Participants will complete the SAGE SR assessment s  on the SAGE SR  Web platform either on a tablet in clinic or at home on a personal computer tablet  The SAGE SR  web platform will process  score  and generate cross informant comparisons if applicable  The SAGE SR  Web system meets HIPAA requirements  Participant SAGE SR data will be stored securely in the SAGE SR  web platform and will be available for export to secure servers on the Partners system  
All other self report questionnaires will be collected and stored electronically using the Research Electronic Data Capture  REDCapTM  software   a free  secure  HIPAA compliant web based application hosted by the Partners HealthCare Research Computing  Enterprise Research Infrastructure & Services  ERIS  group  Using this software  we will build an electronic case report form  eCRF  for this study  which will capture all data collected for this 

research study  Once built  patient participants and study staff can enter data directly into REDCapTM via any computer or tablet with standard web access and browsers  
For in person study visits  study staff will set patient participants up on computers or tablets and will open the survey forms in REDCap for them to use  Direction will be as clear as on paper and pencil tests  If for any reason  any part of any visit cannot be completed in person  all assessments can be conducted remotely  via email and or phone  Research assistants will contact participants via preferred contact method  text  phone  email  or mail  to coordinate the virtual visit  Research assistants will send an encrypted email with a link to REDCap surveys to be completed and a link to the SAGE survey s   To minimize missing data for self report forms  we will program missed question warnings in REDCapTM that will alert participants in real time if they inadvertently skip a question  
The patient reported outcome measure self report questionnaires including the PHQ 2  GAD 2  TAPS  and S2BI will also be integrated into the electronic medical record for the patient s clinician to view  We will train clinic staff on the interpretation of the results of these measures  
Data collected via REDCapTM will be automatically backed up nightly at MGH  To ensure data completeness  data management staff will run weekly reports that highlight incomplete data  Study staff will then be asked to resolve and update data fields flagged by data management staff  In this manner  the database will be proactively and continuously curated to ensure its completeness  and to enable rapid translation into interim reports  
To ensure that REDCap users have access only to data and information that they are supposed to have access to  user privileges can be regulated within REDCap specifically for each project  For the proposed study  we will build distinct profiles that limit access to various functionality and modules  such as being able to export data  to enter data  to add or modify database fields or survey questions  to build or run reports  to modify user privileges  to view the logging records  and so on  
For data safety and integrity purposes it is important to note that REDCap maintains a built in audit trail that logs all user activity and all pages viewed by every user  Whether the activity be entering data  exporting data  modifying a field  running a report  or add modifying a user  among a plethora of other activities  REDCap logs all actions  The logging record can itself be viewed within a project by users that have been given privileges to view the Logging page  The Logging page allows such users to view or export the entire audit trail for that project  and also to filter the audit trail in various ways based upon the type of activity and or user  The built in audit trail in REDCap allows administrators to be able to determine all the activity and all the data viewed or modified by any given user  
Also of note is that all data captured in REDCap for this project will be stored on our own  i e   Partners Healthcare and BMC respectfully  servers  No project data is ever transmitted at any time by REDCap from that institution to another institution or organization  
Data will be transmitted only in pooled form  and subjects will be identified by ID numbers  Any publications of study findings will be reported so that no person can be identified individually  These issues will be clearly stated in consent forms and discussed with participants during the informed consent process  prior to any study related procedures  
In accordance with the NIH NIDA HEAL Initiative  de identified data will be shared with the NIH NIDA in order to create a HEAL Initiative repository  Data shared includes the following 
measures collected from consented participants  NIDA HEAL substance use measure and NIDA HEAL demographic measure  Data managers will provide a de identified data set to NIH NIDA HEAL grant administrators on a quarterly basis or more often if deemed necessary by the research team  
The NIH NIDA will create a closed data repository  which will only be made available to members of the HEAL Initiative and those granted access from the NIH NIDA  The purpose of the repository is to be able to create a large data set based on harmonized measures throughout the sites involved in the HEAL grant in order to increase power of the data analysis conducted  
5  Regulatory and trial safety a  Consentandassent

Due to COVID 19  focus groups  leadership interviews and usability testing may also be conducted virtually over Partners and BMC encrypted Zoom  Potential participants will receive an IRB approved information sheet which discloses the purpose of the study and rights of confidentiality via Partners  BMC encrypted secure email  Potential participants will then be contacted via Partners  BMC encrypted Zoom where the contents of the IRB approved information sheet will be reviewed in detail and the potential participant will be given an opportunity to ask any questions  Following this discussion  and prior to any collection of any study related information  verbal consent to participate in the study will be obtained by research staff  There is no written authorization form for participating in usability testing  
UH3  Study participants will be given in advance a document describing the research and provided with an oral description of the project  Any questions a prospective participant may have about the nature of the research will be answered  Informed written consent assent will then be obtained in person or via REDCap in the case of virtual study activities  The participants of this study must be judged capable of understanding the nature of this study as well as the discomforts and potential benefits  This determination will be made by the research coordinator in consultation with the PI or designee if indicated  Prospective patient participants will not be approached for study participation if they are experiencing any medical or psychiatric condition that is causing acute distress  or if they have an impaired level of attention or arousal due to substance intoxication or withdrawal  The informed consent assent will clearly state that the participant may quit participation at any time during the study visit without penalty  Potential risks and benefits will be explained in full by the project staff  and the participants will be asked to sign a consent assent form  The informed consent assent will be signed by the participants and a member of the study staff  The decision not to participate does not affect eligibility to participate in future studies or to receive treatment at Harvard affiliated hospitals  

b  Adverseeventsandseriousadverseevents 
We are conducting additional observations and analyses of a population undergoing naturalistic treatment  Hence  we do not expect adverse effects directly related to our study  However  possible adverse events include  breaches in patient privacy  discomfort while answering questions or in disclosing personal information about sensitive subjects  and disclosure of information regarding harm to oneself or others and an increase of substance use  
We will report all adverse events and serious adverse events that occur at MGH and are directly related to our study to the Partners Institutional Review Board  NIH Project Officer and the Office for Human Research Protections within 24 hours  Additionally  because the Boston Medical Center IRB will be ceding to the Partners IRB for the UH3 phase of this study  all adverse events and serious adverse events that occur at BMC will be reported to the Partners IRB  At the time of the annual continuing review we will provide the Partners IRB with a summary of any unexpected and related adverse events as well as any other unanticipated problems that occurred since the last continuing review  This annual summary will also be provided to NIDA  
All protocol deviations and amendments will be reported to the Partners IRB and NIDA  
c  Potential risks for participants UG3 and UH3

Given that this study follows ongoing naturalistic interventions and we are not collecting data on treatment related adverse events  interim analysis for safety considerations is not warranted  Should any concern for imminent threat to life  e g  new intravenous use  intentional unintentional OD  unstable mental health  arise during screening  the PIs will contact the participant s provider and  for participants under 18 years of age  parents in addition to the provider  as agreed upon in the signed release of information  
Interim analyses will  however  be conducted for quality assurance and recruitment purposes  The first goal will be to ensure that data are being collected correctly and completely and that we are able to integrate data from the different platforms  e g  REDCapTM  Telesage  PROMs  EMR  to create one cohesive dataset  The second goal will be to gauge the success of recruitment efforts and get a preliminary idea of treatment characteristics by examining the density and duration of treatment

Conflict of interest  
Per the Partners IRB guidelines  all study staff identified by the PIs as being responsible for the design  conduct  or reporting of human subject research must regularly disclose their financial interests through the Partners Disclosure System in Insight  Updates must be made by study staff within 30 days of any change in financial interests  The Office for Interactions with Industry  OII  will review this information and make recommendations  The OII will determine if the disclosed financial interests are 1  acceptable  2  acceptable with some form of management  3  not acceptable  All investigators will abide by NIH COI requirements  
DSM report  
The PIs  in consultation with other Key Personnel  will generate a DSM report annually  This report will include  
A brief description of progress An enrolment update 
The retention and disposition of participants 
Adverse events and severe adverse events 
Any regulatory issues  including  amendments  protocol deviations  IRB reports  and quality assurance issues 
DSMBoard 
This is a naturalistic longitudinal study  Hence  a formal DSMB is not required  9  Importance of Knowledge to be Gained 
Despite the onset of up to three quarters of SUDs in young people  and that high rates of SUD are seen in those with behavioral health disorders  there is a lack of substance use screening completed in high risk clinics  If successful  our study will be among the first to implement and systematize the identification of substance use in behavioral health clinics  Moreover  our study will answer long standing and critical questions  for instance  does treating psychopathology mitigate the longer term development of OUD  nicotine and other SUDs  Does treating young people with less severe SUD prevent the onset of OUD and or more severe SUD  Moreover  we will be able to address the mechanisms of risk reduction  
The study is reasonable to conduct as the risks to the subjects are minimal  as detailed above   while the benefits  in behavioral health and substance use settings  are of the highest clinical and public health utility and may result in large benefits to patients  families and society  
Emory University and Cherokee Nation Behavioral Health are conducting a cluster randomized trial and will randomize 16 24 high schools  located within the jurisdictional  boundaries of the Cherokee Nation in rural northeastern Oklahoma  to preventive  intervention or delay program control conditions  The trial will include survey data from a  cohort of approximately 1000 to 1500 youth  ages 15 to 20  followed over three years  
Federally recognized tribes enjoy special protections as domestic dependent sovereignties  As such  any entity other than the Cherokee Nation  including its  research intensive partner  Emory University  or the sponsor of the study  wishing to  access  view or use the data from this study must request explicit permission from the  Cherokee Nation prior to data access  must agree to abide by all requirements of the  Cherokee Nation review process  and must comply with any conditions the Cherokee  Nation requires for data access or use  
Data collected as part of this trial are particularly sensitive for several reasons  The  entire trial is conducted collaboratively with the Cherokee Nation and conducted entirely  within the territory under the jurisdiction of the Cherokee Nation  Thus  it will be  impossible to share these data without identifying the tribe  Second  some behaviors the  subject of survey items are illegal  Third  the study communities and their high schools  are quite small  as a result  the deductive identification of individuals by patterns of  survey responses might be easily accomplished  even with access to a standard  dataset cleaned of all obvious identifiers  Fourth  there is a long history in the U S  of  mistreatment and harmful non equal collaboration with tribes  including by actors in the  research community  
The NIH convened a Tribal Collaboration Working Group of the All of Us Research  Program Advisory Group  https   allofus nih gov about who we are tribal collaboration working group all us research program advisory panel   The Tribal Collaboration  Working Group  TCWG  completed a report that identifies strategies for developing  meaningful  culturally sensitive collaborations with AI AN populations  https   allofus nih gov sites default files tribal collab work group rept pdf   Relevant  highlights  directly quoted  from the report include  
   Tribal sovereignty ensures that any decisions regarding tribal members  and tribal property are made with their participation and consent    p 7     This sovereign status  which is a political designation  gives tribes legal  rights and privileges that are distinct from racial and ethnic groups  
Research partnerships with AI AN populations require unique  
   considerations  including greater input and oversight by tribal communities  on data and biospecimen policies  beyond those for other groups    p 7     Many tribal nations and individuals are hesitant to participate in  biomedical research due to historical transgressions by both the federal  government and researchers    p 9  
   Some research has stigmatized or harmed AI AN tribes    p 9  
   Some researchers have also engaged in practices that violate tribal  beliefs    p 9  
The researchers at Emory University  in partnership with Cherokee Nation Behavioral  Health  agree to securely collect  and store project data  and further agree to share the  study data  provided all data requests are reviewed and approved by the Cherokee  Nation IRB  It is the responsibility of any external party requesting access to project data  to request in writing to the project PI the specific data requested  and to apply to the  Cherokee Nation IRB for such access according to procedures promulgated by the  Cherokee Nation  Further  any such access is conditional on meeting all requirements  specified by the Cherokee Nation IRB  
Cohort tracking and survey databases will be linked by arbitrarily assigned study  numbers  not students  school ID or other such numbers  to ensure identifying  information is not contained in the survey databases  Survey data collected from study participants will be transmitted immediately via cellular connected tablets using  REDCap or Qualtrics to the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health HIPAA  secure server  REDCap and Qualtrics are secure web applications for building and  managing online surveys and databases  They are HIPAA compliant and secured  Once  each wave of data is collected  checks will be run for data consistency and quality   Processes are in place to generate individual and school de identified databases for  analyses  Study data will be maintained on an Emory University Rollins School of Public  Health HIPAA secure server during and after the active study phase  Emory University  will not share data without approval from the Cherokee Nation Institutional Review  Board  Furthermore  the Emory researchers agree to submit all presentations and  manuscripts to the Cherokee Nation IRB for review and approval prior to public  dissemination or publication  a requirement that will also apply to any external party  requesting data access  
The analysis dataset will include self reported demographic and behavioral data from self reported surveys of study participants  including drug use behaviors  Because we  are following a cohort of youth ages 15 to 20 over three years  we will be collecting  identifying information for tracking to re survey respondents  Even though the final  dataset will be stripped of individual and school identifiers prior to release for sharing   there remains the reasonable possibility of deductive disclosure of participants with  unusual characteristics given the small  socially identifiable population under study  and  small size of the high schools within these low population count rural communities within the jurisdictional territory of the Cherokee Nation  Thus  we will make the data  and associated documentation available to users only under a negotiated data sharing 
agreement that provides for   1  review and approval of the data request and study  protocol by the Cherokee Nation IRB   2  a commitment to using the data only for  research purposes   3  restrictions against attempting to identify study participants   4  a  commitment to securing the data using secure computer technology   5  a commitment  to destroying data after the specific requested analyses are completed   6  agreement  to submit all presentations and manuscripts to the appropriate tribal authorities for  review and approval prior to public dissemination and publication   7  reporting  responsibilities to the Cherokee Nation   8  restrictions on redistribution of the data to  third parties  and  9  proper acknowledgement of the source of the data  Any entity  other than the Cherokee Nation wishing to access  view or use the data from this study  must request explicit permission from the Cherokee Nation and must agree to abide by  the Cherokee Nation IRB review process and conditions imposed thereby  In some  instances  the Cherokee Nation may require that their communities not be identified   this precaution is taken to protect the community from harm  which may occur due to  careless disclosure of sensitive information about a small socially identifiable  population  
The Emory University and Cherokee Nation Behavioral Health team are committed to  maximize the availability of publications and the sharing of underlying data from our  project  Our public access and data sharing plan includes  
Electronic copies of all publications will be deposited within four weeks of  acceptance by a journal in PubMed Central  
All publications are planned to be open access and dedicated to the public  domain  
All publications will be made publicly available immediately without any embargo  period  
Underlying Primary Data for the Publications will be made available to outside  individuals via written request from the PI and with approval of a data sharing  agreement with the Cherokee Nation  as described above  Contact information  for the PI will be listed on all manuscripts and publications as a means to facilitating access to the data   
To meet program goals under the NIH HEAL Initiative  we understand that  the  NIH requires broad and responsible sharing of Underlying Primary Data from  NIH Supported NIH HEAL Initiative Research Projects that protects and  maintains the privacy and confidentiality of participant data  If the research  involves human subjects  as defined by 45  R  462  the Public Access and  Data Sharing Plan should discuss how the privacy rights of participants and  confidentiality of their data will be protected and maintained in accordance with  45 46 and other applicable laws and regulations   
To meet these requirements  survey databases will be linked by arbitrarily assigned study numbers for participants  not students  school ID or other such  numbers  and schools to ensure individual  and school level identifying  information is not contained in the survey databases  Race ethnic identifiers will  only include broad categories  including American Indian ancestry  Tribal 
citizenship will not be included in shared data sets to help protect the identity of  small populations and samples  unless  1  tribal identity is an important aspect of  the research   2  the sample size for that particular tribe is large enough to  protect individual confidentiality  and  3  with the permission of the Cherokee  Nation  Processes are in place to generate de identified databases for analyses   which will not include individual or school level identifiers  School cohort sample  sizes range from approximately 30 to 90 students  Additional demographic and  other variables may be omitted for small school samples to protect the possible  identification of individuals and schools  
NIH s Certificate of Confidentiality  CoC  policy automatically issues a CoC for  any NIH funded projects using identifiable  sensitive information  The CoC gives  the researchers the authority to not release identifying information  even if  subpoenaed to do so   
NIH requires that the Applicant should discuss the potential risks to research  participants posed by data sharing and steps taken to address those risks  
The study s parent consent and youth assent forms include information regarding  the sharing of de identified data  
Some of your information may be placed into public databases for other  researchers to use  Anything we share would only use a code number  instead of your name  In addition to not including your name  researchers  will need to sign data use agreements before using or seeing the data  We  will remove or code any personal information that could identify you before  your information is shared  This will ensure that  by current scientific  standards and known methods  it is extremely unlikely that anyone would  be able to identify you from the information we share  Despite these  measures  we cannot promise that your answers could not be linked back  to you  
The Cherokee Nation and Emory University IRBs have reviewed and approved  this Public Access and Data Sharing Plan  
We will abide with the principles of the data and resource policy developed by the HEAL Prevention Initiative Steering Committee  consistent with the relevant NIH  policies  laws and regulations  while simultaneously protecting the identity and  confidentiality of the study sample and the Cherokee Nation  a small socially  identifiable population  Federally recognized tribes enjoy special protections as  domestic dependent sovereignties  As such  any entity other than the Cherokee  Nation wishing to access  view or use the data from this study will need to  request explicit permission from the Cherokee Nation and must agree to abide by  the procedures and requirements of the Cherokee Nation IRB review process
RESOURCE SHARING PLAN  

For the proposed R61 33 project  Data Sharing will be consistent with the practices used by Dr  Carroll s research and data management team in other trials  For all projects  anonymized data sets are developed for sharing with other investigators within and outside Yale to support meta analysis and secondary analysis projects   

In general  one master data file is created for each study that includes all variables necessary to address the primary study aims and hypotheses  The master data set  following the guidelines of the Data Analysis Plan  is fast tracked for data cleaning and locking  Detailed codebooks are prepared describing variable names and descriptions and specifications for each form   In compliance with HIPAA  the master data set does not include any personally identifiable information  Once the primary data set is created  case report forms collected for secondary analyses are then cleaned and prepared for use and archiving   Final master data sets include  for each study  demographic and baseline information on drug use and related problems  ASI data  information on treatment compliance and outcome  treatment fidelity data where appropriate  as well as substance use outcomes from urinalyses and self report   

All data are de identified before sharing  using procedures that are in compliance with HIPPA and Yale Human Investigation Committee standards  No datasets contain subject names  addresses or other specific personal identification
