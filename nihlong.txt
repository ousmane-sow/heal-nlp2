
We  comply with all NIH HEAL Initiative Resource and Data Sharing policies established during the project period A data repository  be set up by NIH for all HEAL Initiative projects and all data and resources as outlined below  be shared to the designated NIH HEAL repository The NIH HCS Research Collaboratory Program has established a Collaboratory Coordinating Center to provide technical expertise in embedded pragmatic trials in health care systems In accordance with NIH Collaboratory policies we  prepare the primary analysis datasets at a minimum for submission to the Collaboratory Coordinating Center In accordance with ICJME policies we  prepare the primary analysis datasets for review and reproducibility by peer reviewed journals We  prepare the final datasets and accompanying resource documents for final deposit to the designated NIH HEAL data repository 
We  use the Data and or Materials only as outlined by the NIH HEAL Initiative in a manner that is consistent with applicable state and federal laws and regulations including any informed consent requirements and the terms of the institution s NIH funding including 
The results  be made public in multiple ways 
Regular presentations at national and international scientific meetings We  present in abstract form at least once per year and the PIs  also present the data in invited talks seminars and workshops 
All data  be analyzed and published in peer reviewed literature Means standard deviations sample sizes  always be published 
Publication of datasets and resources We  make available publicly any provider and patient educational materials to facilitate widespread implementation of the intervention as outlined in detail below The datasets and accompanying resources  be made available to the designated NIH HEAL data repository according to the NIH Collaboratory program policies 
Resource Sharing As part of the NIH Collaboratory we  share resources including the Protocol Informed 
Consent template Manual of Procedures Statistical Analysis Plan Data Dictionary Annotated Case report Forms 
 CRFs CRF Mapping Spreadsheet and ReadMe files These  be posted to a central study website managed by 
the NIH Collaboratory Coordinating Center that is publicly available and made available upon request 
Data Sharing The current study is expected to generate patient reported outcomes for individuals with fibromyalgia across a broad spectrum of domains pain fatigue function psychological factors and quality of life We  also collect some data from the electronic health record about number of physical therapy visits CPT codes for treatments and the patient specific functional scale In addition we  have TENS usage data downloaded from the TENS devices that  show the number of minutes of TENS use and the number of minute sessions completed Data  be collected prior to the intervention baseline data and and days after enrollment 
Lastly we  collect data from clinics across healthcare systems Data regarding usage of physical therapy services billing codes treatment patterns of care for those with fibromyalgia for a given clinic or healthcare population could be used inappropriately to compare clinics or healthcare systems and could reveal proprietary health systems business information Therefore patient level data  be deidentified and stored in aggregate Identifiers for healthcare system and patients  be removed 
Analysis datasets  be made available at the time of publication of the primary manuscript Complete datasets and 

accompanying resources  be deposited to the designated NIH HEAL initiative data repository after the completion of the primary aim manuscript 
Publications  be made available to the public using open access publishing so they become available immediately to the public All publications  be accessible through PubMED google scholar and available to the public through open access 
A final close out checklist for data and resource sharing developed by the NIH Collaboratory Coordinating Center  be used and maintained by the study team in consultation with the NIH Collaboratory Coordinating Center
A primary goal of the OBOE Study Consortium is to facilitate discoveries by the broad scientific community RTI realizes data sharing is an important way to increase the ability of researchers scientists and policy makers to analyze and translate data into meaningful reports and knowledge The data collected through the OBOE Study are expected to provide a wealth of information regarding impacts of antenatal opioid exposure and NOWs with the expectation that these study results could potentially lead to intervention studies to improve outcomes for these vulnerable infants The plan for sharing the study data and the potential for an imaging repository demand carefully developed strategies that are cognizant of the importance of protecting participants rights to individual privacy and are compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of HIPAA regulations NIH requirements and the Consortium policies and procedures We have collaborated with NICHD to establish data sharing plans for previous studies and we propose to follow those best practices for this study For data sharing to conform to the strictest standards of data protection one or both of the following approaches may be considered 
The Consortium s informed consent form must contain language informing parents that their and their child s data  be put into a database consisting of information from all the participants in the study and that data may be shared with other Consortium investigators the study sponsor and applicable federal agencies and may be shared for future research under the NIH Public Access Policy 
After the study is completed data for the entire study may be stripped of identifying information and may be shared with outside researchers including for instance submitting de identified data to the NICHD Data and Specimen Hub DASH MRI images shared through the neuroimaging core at Children s National Medical Center s XNAT platform or other public databases in compliance with the NIH Public Access Policy 
Approval of requests for data and other study materials  be contingent on the OBOE Study SC approval and compliance with NICHD data sharing policies relevant local state and federal laws such as those regarding intellectual property and the Certificate of Confidentiality 
Measures to Protect Patient Confidentiality 
The OBOE Study Consortium  take great care to ensure that participant confidentiality is maintained in all shared data Shared data can be aggregated at the individual study center level aggregated as microdata with no identifiers or aggregated as micro data with one or more identifiers Data may also be shared at several levels with investigators at our Clinical Sites and with outside investigators Each level of aggregating and sharing data carries its own level of disclosure risk The DCC  work with the OBOE SC to develop a data sharing plan that  strike a balance between the protection of participants rights and the desire for scientific collaboration The plan  address the following issues the expected disclosure risk level for each type of data sharing which data types can be shared the types of people within the study or outside the study who can access data at various levels the form of participant parental informed consent required for each level of data sharing and procedures for review and approval of data access request applications 
Public Use Datasets 
We  comply with the NIH requirements for sharing data through the creation of public use datasets We  follow established procedures to ensure that publicly released data satisfy all HIPAA and any related requirements for protecting participant identity including the following 
Replacing the unique participant identification variable in the original datasets with a new unique participant identifier produced by a random number generator 
Removing any personal information from the dataset much of this type of data is not included in the data submitted to the DCC by the Clinical Sites 
Removing or recoding other distinguishing parameters such as dates research site identification numbers and hospitals where medical procedures were performed For example dates can be recoded relative to a participant specific reference point and specific locations can be replaced by more general geographic codes 
Combining subgroups with low frequencies or truncating distributions to ensure that there are a minimum number of participants for each category or value within each gender ethnicity cell 
In collaboration with the OBOE SC the DCC  develop a data management plan that addresses final data documentation and archival considerations from the beginning of the project We  follow current best practices for creating maintaining and documenting all OBOE Study datasets to ensure preservation of accurate and usable data and metadata while protecting the privacy of the study participants 
Data Sharing Using the NICHD Data and Specimen Hub N DASH 
N DASH provides a centralized resource for investigators to share and access data from NICHD funded research The submission of OBOE Study data to N DASH  help N DASH achieve the goal of being a one stop shop for researchers interested in performing secondary analyses using data generated by NICHD projects 
The DCC for the OBOE Consortium has fully engaged in data submission to N DASH and has defined processes and procedures for de identifying the data providing Institutional Certifications compiling required documentation files entering descriptive study information and summary statistics on study participant characteristics and submitting materials through the dashboard and they  be able to draw on the expertise and experience of other RTI DCC staff as necessary to complete the OBOE Study submission as needed With approval from the OBOE SC the DCC  follow these steps for submission to DASH 
Data De identification Following the DASH de identification guidance the DCC proposes to create new study ID numbers scramble site ID numbers and retain birth years with all dates changed to day of life or day of study by the primary study statistician Datasets  not include any data that meet specific criteria that might allow the participant to be identified including but not limited to cells for categorical measures with less than prevalence individual continuous measures that lie more than standard deviations from the median or any variable considered to be a unique identifier Before submission the OBOE SC  determine and the DCC  document exceptions reasons for not including specific variables These de identified data and associated documents  be reviewed by the OBOE SC before submission to DASH Additionally an overview document  be provided to RTI s Data Security Officer and the sIRB to ensure our proposed processes are sufficient to fully protect the confidentiality of study participants 
Documentation Final documentation for de identified versions of the public use datasets  include annotated CRFs for clinical datasets derived variable specifications for analysis datasets data dictionaries for all datasets and programs and documentation created during harmonization processes including mappings between clinical and harmonized variables and descriptions of any discrepancies between the public use datasets and published manuscript Once the public use files have been prepared we  share submission with the OBOE SC and the NICHD Program Scientist Upon their approval the materials  be submitted to N DASH no later than the acceptance for publication of the main findings from the final dataset Submissions  include additional documents required by N DASH including the study protocol 
Sharing Imaging Data Using Children s National Medical Center s XNAT Platform 
XNAT is an open source imaging informatics software platform with core functions that manage imports archives and processes and securely distributes imaging and related study data Through XNAT the OBOE Consortium can create a centralized public imaging data resource 
XNAT includes an online image viewer that supports common neuroimaging formats including DICOM and Analyze XNAT uses quality control procedures that  allow for the level of data de identification described above for archived MRI images Data can be entered into the archive as XML or through data entry forms User access is provided via secure web application With OBOE Study images archived in XNAT long term integrity of the data is maintained and can be shared with the broader neuroimaging community when approved by the OBOE Study SC 
Genomic Data Sharing 
Genomic and pharmacogenomic studies are not part of the Specific Aims of the OBOE Study proposal However if genomic and pharmacogenomic secondary studies for participants in this study are added to the protocol the OBOE Consortium  comply with NIH requirements for sharing genomic data 
Sharing Model Organisms 
Not applicable 
Sharing Research Resources 
The only sharable resource the OBOE Study Consortium anticipates generating for this research study is the data and MRI images from the study 
Data Sharing Plan
The Wake Forest NCORP Research Base WF NCORP RB  fully adhere to the data sharing goals policies and timelines defined by the NIH and  follow the NIH guidelines for publications by assisting in and assuring submission to a PubMed Central indexed venue or depositing peer reviewed full manuscripts into the NIH Manuscript Submission system NIHMS 

Data Sharing The WF NCORP RB believes that data sharing and exchange stimulates the development of new and novel approaches in cancer control and cancer delivery research studies and is committed to following the NIH Statement on Sharing Research Data The primary means of data sharing and dissemination is typically through scientific publications and presentations so we are committed to presenting and publishing results of all studies in a timely manner Additionally we have links on the WF NCORP RB website to all publications where available Previously the WF NCORP RB would share de identified raw data upon request As of July the WF NCORP RB signed an agreement with NCI to contribute de identified data and data dictionaries from clinical trials conducted through our RB to the NCI NCTN NCORP data archive within months of primary and non primary publications of phase II III and phase III trials to This  become the primary means for sharing raw data and we  adhere to the guidelines spelled out in the NCTN NCORP Data Archive Usage Guide De identified raw data from studies that are not covered by the agreement e g phase II and observational studies  still be made available upon request Ensuring patient privacy and confidentiality  be of primary importance in creating files to be shared All data files  be de identified that is data intended for sharing  be stripped of all variables considered personal health identifiers by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA In addition variables that could permit linkages to individual research participants and variables that could lead to deductive disclosure of the identity of individual subjects  be removed or recoded De identification procedures  meet the HIPAA criteria as detailed in the Code of Federal Regulations Part Section

Genomics Data Sharing including Genome Wide Association Studies GWAS Any studies in which WF NCORP RB generates research data from genomics  be shared according to the specified timelines and methods requested by the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy available which is built on top of the Data Sharing Policy for GWAS The WF NCORP RB  deposit genome sequencing SNPs and expression profiling data as described in the policies

We are committed to making available to the public the results and accomplishments of the activities of this project in accordance with the NIH Data Sharing Policy from the NIH Collaboratory Coordinating Center We expect to generate data from sickle cell patients who are primarily Black African American and from low socioeconomic status We plan to achieve our data sharing goals in a number of ways 
We are committed to implementing the NIH Health Care Systems Research Collaboratory Data Sharing Policy 
The Collaboratory investigators  each share at a minimum a final research data set upon which the primary pragmatic trial publication is based 
Sharing data derived from clinical care in studies performed in partnership with health care systems may under some situations require precautions in addition to those regarding patient confidentiality to protect specific interests of collaborating health care systems facilities or providers 
Consistent with NIH policy and guidance the Collaboratory investigators  choose the least restrictive method for sharing of research data that provides appropriate protection for participant privacy health system privacy and scientific integrity 
The Collaboratory investigators  work with NIH to implement this data sharing policy to ensure the appropriate administrative processes and technical infra structure are in place to support timely data sharing for the Collaboratory 
We  adhere to the following key points of the NIH Data Sharing Policy 
This Policy applies to all human data in the NIH IRP including the NIH Clinical Center as well as NIH Institutes and Centers 
A Data Sharing Plan must be developed for any research involving human data 
Data Sharing Plans  be included in the institute scientific review process for research involving human data 
The Institute Scientific Director SD or their designee is responsible for approving all Data Sharing Plans 
All IRP supported clinical investigators are expected to develop protocols and consent processes forms to enable broad data sharing for secondary research consistent with this Policy 
Sharing data for secondary research purposes shall comply with human subjects research regulations and procedures if applicable 
All IRP investigators are encouraged to deposit data in publicly accessible research repositories for sharing to the extent feasible and appropriate 
This Policy is effective as of October Any intramural research involving human data undergoing scientific review after October must have a data sharing plan
Direct Sharing of Primary Data 
The final data set  include self reported demographics and behavioral data from self report questionnaires and interviews The final data set  be stripped of individual identifiers prior to release for sharing Underlying Primary Data  be de identified according to the standards set forth in the HHS Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects to ensure that the identities of research subjects cannot be readily ascertained with the data Underlying Primary Data  be stripped of identifiers according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA Privacy Rule Participants  be notified prior to providing their informed consent that de identified study data  be shared 
The data and associated documentation  be made available to users only under a data sharing agreement that provides for a a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual patient b a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology and c a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed Such a data use agreement  be executed through the PIs and the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Nursing The database can then be accessed via our secure website in a format that can be used by a variety of statistical software packages We  make our data and results publicly available predominately online so that they can easily be found 
Indirect Data Sharing Plan 
We  publish our results in open source manuscripts that  be available to the public Electronic copies of publications  be deposited in PubMed Central with proper tagging of metadata to ensure online discoverability and accessibility within four weeks of acceptance by a journal Publications  be published under the Creative Commons Attribution Generic License or an equivalent license or otherwise dedicated to the public domain e g Creative Commons public domain tool To the extent feasible Underlying Primary Data  be shared simultaneously with the publication and made immediately accessible through release under the Creative Commons Attribution Generic License or an equivalent license or otherwise dedicated to the public domain Creative Commons public domain tool CC Before submitting Underlying Primary Data we  work with our Institutional Review Board IRB and Data Safety and Monitoring Board to assess the informed consent materials and to determine whether the Underlying Primary Data may be shared as contemplated in this policy For more ways we  indirectly share our data please see our dissemination plan 
DATA SHARING PLAN 
The proposed research  involve a sample subjects recruited from the Boulder CO and surrounding area with chronic lower back pain There are two primary sets of data being collected outcome measures related to AIM pain intensity and QoL and outcome measures related to AIM fMRI data 
AIM Data This data is specific to the proprietary VRNT product so use of the participant level data sets in other research has limited value The data is also proprietary 
AIM Data Anonymized fMRI data  be shared on data open science repositories In addition the University of Colorado team have developed several open source software packages in Matlab and Python for performing some of the proposed analyses that are available on github a cloud based code sharing repository 
Data Sharing Plan 
Policies and Timing 
After last subject enrollment and all follow up procedures have been completed the HEAL Pain Management Effectiveness Research Network Data Coordinating Center DCC at the University of Utah  prepare a final study database for the trial which  then be used for statistical analyses and publication of findings from the trial 
The Trial  provide a very rich resource of data concerning methods for managing pain and reducing opioid addiction and the DCC  produce a database that can be used by non ERN investigators The policies for release of this database  be determined by the NIH These policies are expected to focus primarily on the timing of data release Our preliminary plan is to release the database defined below at the time of publication of the primary manuscript or within months of last patient procedure whichever comes first Implementation of the plan  follow the HEAL Public Access and Data Sharing Policy as outlined at
Releasable Database 
A releasable database  be produced and  be completely de identified in accordance with the definitions provided in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA Namely all identifiers specified in HIPAA  be recoded in a manner that  make it impossible to deduce or impute the specific identity of any patient The database  not contain any institutional identifiers 
The DCC  also prepare a data dictionary that provides a concise definition of every data element included in the database If specific data elements have idiosyncrasies that might affect interpretation or analysis this  be discussed in the dictionary document Data elements that are considered unreliable  be deleted and this  be noted in the documentation 
In accordance with policies of the NIH the DCC  send the releasable database to the entity determined by the NIH or specific institute to be the repository for data created under the HEAL initiative The DCC is able to produce a relational database export or use SAS or SPSS data sets The DCC  accompany the database with full documentation so that individual investigators  be able to effectively use the data 
Access to Data 
Access to the releasable database housed in the NIH assigned repository  be in accordance with procedures and regulations of the NIH or specific institute The DCC  not provide any support for investigators using the releasable database 
On June th we met with HEAL Data Stewards during office hours to discuss the Data Asset Inventory We explained that it was difficult to answer many of these questions because our HEAL award is a supplement to a pre existing award and did not require a Public Access or Data Sharing Plan The HEAL Data Stewards recommended that we select Not Sure as responses to items without a clear answer and to submit this paragraph describing our conversation They planned to discuss how to handle data sharing for supplements with HEAL program administrators and report back to the Project Manager 
Data Sharing Plan 
Sharing of data generated by this project  be an essential part of the EPPIC Network activities and  be carried out in several different ways We expect that the results from the EPPIC Network studies  be made available to the community of scientists interested in the treatment of chronic pain and in the identification of biomarkers for specific pain syndromes and potentially treatment response As a member of the EPPIC network we would welcome collaboration with others who are interested in extending the results of our clinical studies 
In our role as a Specialized Clinical Center our plan  include the following 
Presentations at national scientific meetings and publications It is expected that presentations of specific results  be made at national meetings and through publications as appropriate As in any network there  need to be a process for deciding who  take primary responsibility for the write up and presentation of the research and what role the overall group of investigators  play in the process This process  need to be presented and discussed an early face to face meeting of the network with the assumption that there  be appointment of a publication committee to consider proposals from the network investigators to access analyze write up present and publish interesting findings It is expected that the investigators from the EPPIC Network  be active participants of the creation of this sub group 
Newsletter It is expected that the Data Coordinating Center DCC and Clinical Coordinating Center CCC  have the primary role for communication between the Specialized Clinical Centers SCC which  happen primarily via e mail but might benefit from a regular newsletter format to report on progress problems solutions etc 
Sharing of the Clinical Trial Data It is the responsibility of the SCCs to upload data to the DCC and respond to queries to ensure high quality data Upon completion of the data collection analysis interpretation and initial publication of the results of any clinical trial it  be the responsibility of the DCC or CCC to upload the data in an appropriate format to the NIH Repository and share the data with any reasonable request from other researcher The SCCs  assist as needed but are not expected to primarily share the full data sets 
Data Sharing Plan 
The proposed research  include data from approximately total subjects consisting of young adults ages presenting for treatment with Opioid Use Disorder The final dataset  include self reported demographic and behavioral data from interviews with the subjects and laboratory data from urine specimens provided as well as treatment utilization data gleaned from their health care providers It  also include qualitative data from a subset of the participants whose exact nature is somewhat unpredictable given open ended interviewing formats In particular we  be collecting information throughout the dataset about highly sensitive information including illegal drug use and other criminal activity 
Even though the final dataset  be deidentified prior to release for sharing we believe that there remains the possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects with unusual characteristics Thus we  make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data sharing agreement that provides for a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology and other sufficient security procedures and a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed 
We  strictly adhere to the NIH Grant Policy on Sharing of Unique Research Resources including the Sharing of Biomedical Research Resources Principles and Guidelines for Recipients of NIH Grants and Contracts issued in December We  make reagents developed under this proposal available to our colleagues upon request except in the instance when sharing such materials or associated information could negatively the protection of new intellectual property Any clones packaged virus or stable cell lines generated to support the aims of this project  be distributed freely and  be made available to the broader research community either before or immediately after publication of manuscripts We  provide relevant protocols or other requested reagents upon request All published data  be published in peer reviewed journals and large datasets  be deposited into appropriate publicly accessible repositories 
Sharing of data generated by this project is an essential part of our proposed activities and  be carried out in several different ways The Persist Study wishes to make our results available both to the community of scientists interested in substance use chronic pain and medication assisted treatment Conversely we would welcome collaboration with others who could make use of the assessment protocols developed in the Persist Study 

Our plan includes the following 

What data  be shared 
The Persist Study  share quantitative data collected during all study time points baseline and follow up assessments This data includes demographics substance use history buprenorphine treatment history and history with chronic pain This data  be deposited at which are NIH suggested repositories 

Who  have access to the data 
The Persist Study agrees that data  be deposited and made available through which are NIH suggested repositories and that these data  be shared with investigators working under an institution with a Federal Wide Assurance FWA and could be used for secondary study purposes such as comparing pain functioning to medication retention The Persist Study agrees that the names and Institutions of persons either given or denied access to the data and the bases for such decisions  be summarized in the annual progress report Meta analysis data and associated data along with data content format and organization  be made available to investigators through 

Where  the data be shared The Persist Study agrees to deposit and maintain the data and secondary analysis of data if any at which are NIH suggested repositories and that these repositories have data access policies and procedures consistent with NIH data sharing policies 

When  the data be shared 
The Persist Study agrees to deposit outcome data into repositories as soon as possible but no later than within one year of the completion of the funded project period for the parent award or upon acceptance of the data for publication or public disclosure of a submitted patent application whichever is earlier 

How  researchers locate and access the data 
The Persist Study agrees to identify where the data  be available and how to access the data in any publications and presentations that Principle Investigators Mark Ilgen and Allison Lin author or co author about these data as well as acknowledge the repository and funding source in any publications and presentations As our project  be using which are NIH suggested repositories these repositories have policies and procedures in place that  provide data access to qualified researchers fully consistent with NIH data sharing policies and applicable laws and regulations 

The sharing of data generated through this project Injectable naltrexone month depot formulations is an essential part of the proposed activities as the project reaches the proposed milestones With the goal of this project to develop a product for the treatment of opioid dependence every effort  be utilized to disseminate the data in an attempt to transform the research and technology developments of PLGA based systems into future usable products and life saving measures We aim to disseminate the data through several outlets to the community of scientists doctors and patients interested in the treatment of opioid dependence and also the prevention of overdose Additionally we are openly welcome to collaboration with others who can aid in the development or use the sustained release formulation technologies developed in this project 

Our plan includes 

Posters Presentations at international scientific meetings From the project we envision that at least once annually a poster presentation  be appropriate The Controlled Release Society annual meeting of which the PI was a program chair for is an excellent opportunity to present the data This day meeting presents information on a variety of controlled release drug delivery systems 

Scientific Manuscripts It is expected that at least one scientific manuscript  result from the project each year and the data  be published in a representative journal such as Pharmaceutical Research In addition all final peer reviewed manuscripts resulting from data generated from this project  be submitted to the digital archive PubMed Central 
 
Focused Groups and Websites A number of focus groups and websites exist for the treatment of substance abuse specifically opioids due to the current epidemic Summaries of research findings  be submitted to the websites geared for a general audience in an effort to provide the information to the population outside the scientific community 
Data Dissemination Plan 
The New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University are committed to the open and timely dissemination of research outcomes We understand that promising new methods technologies data and insights may arise during the course of our research We are aware of and agree to abide by the principles for sharing research resources as described by NIH in the NIH Policy on the Dissemination of NIH Funded Clinical Trial Information Accordingly the studies proposed in the current application  be registered and maintained on ClinicalTrials gov and upon conclusion of the study the results  be reported to and available on this site Data  also be shared via posters or talks at international academic conferences such as the College on Problems of Drug Dependence CPDD and the International Narcotics Research Conference INRC Research manuscripts reporting the findings from the specific aims outlined in this proposal  be submitted for publication in peer reviewed journals We feel this constitutes an acceptable mechanism for disseminating our results
Opioid use disorders OUD are among the most severe and deadly substance use disorders SUD in young people Psychiatric disorders pose one of the major risks to develop opioid and other SUDs For instance young people with psychopathology are at two to three fold increased risk to develop nicotine alcohol opioid and drug use disorders Reciprocally very high rates of psychopathology have been reported in samples of young people with OUD and other SUDs This is particularly important since up to three quarters of psychiatric and SUDs onset in childhood or young adulthood Despite psychopathology robustly increasing the risk for later substance related disorders remarkably little has been completed examining the impact of treating psychopathology on reducing rates of OUD nicotine and other SUDs Given the common prevalence of juvenile psychopathology and the high morbidity and mortality associated with OUD and other SUDs identification of substance use and psychopathology as well as elucidating the longer term impacts and intervening relationships of treatment of psychopathology on OUD nicotine and other SUDs in behavioral health and substance use settings in young people is of the highest clinical and public health utility 
Study Design Overview New and existing patients in the outpatient behavioral health and SUD clinics at Massachusetts General Hospital MGH and Boston Medical Center BMC who are ages to years and do not have an OUD  be recruited to evaluate the impact of treatment of psychopathology with symptom monitoring through patient related outcome measures PROMs on the development of an OUD nicotine and other SUDs PROMs  be implemented in behavioral health clinics and integrated into the electronic medical record to systematically assess patient participant self report of psychiatric symptoms and substance use at baseline and longitudinally Using identical methodology we  also be evaluating the effect of dual diagnosis treatment with non OUD SUD to examine if treatment mitigates the onset of OUD In addition to PROMs information regarding treatment psychological characteristics substance use social environment and quality adjusted life years  be collected to assess research outcomes PROMs  allow patient participants and clinicians to use validated measurements to evaluate an individual s response to treatment that can be feasibly implemented into young persons behavioral and SUD health care At the end of the study propensity score matching  be used to evaluate the effect of treatment of psychopathology on the development of OUD nicotine and other SUDs Data derived from this study  help inform clinical guidelines public health policy and provide important secondary outcomes for further work on the prevention of OUD nicotine and SUD in relation to early onset psychopathology

Powerandstatisticalanalysisplan 
Aim I All transcripts of focus groups and individual interviews  be independently coded by two trained research assistants using NVivo software and an a priori developed codebook The RE AIM framework and CFIR constructs  be used to evaluate barriers and facilitators to PROMS implementation Additionally we  calculate the percentage of new and existing patient participants who completed PROMs the percentage of patient participants who complete PROMs during follow up and the percentage of providers who view and document PROMs We  also calculate the percentage of patients with S BI TAPS positive screens 
Aims II III & IV Because this is a study involving well documented treatment methods for psychiatric disorders it would be unethical to withhold treatment from participants and therefore we cannot randomize treatment during enrollment Furthermore we expect treatment status to change throughout the study so defining treatment groups at enrollment would not capture true treatment patterns over the course of the trial Therefore we  categorize patients as having high versus low treatment exposure at the end of the study using a definition similar to the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD We  define treatment exposure of the study period as high treatment exposure < as low treatment exposure 
Given this quasi experimental design we consider two potential methods for analysis that account for the fact that treatment allocation was not randomly assigned The first method is a mixed effects regression model adjusted for potential confounders using propensity scores This method utilizes the complete dataset and is robust against outliers However it requires many assumptions and does not guarantee that the treatment groups  be sufficiently balanced for potential confounders The second method is a treatment effects model with propensity score matching This method requires fewer assumptions allows us to evaluate the similarity of the treated and untreated groups creates comparable groups using information that is independent from the outcome allows us to directly examine the balance of characteristics in the matched sample and as with regression adjustment is robust against outliers However the method has some limitations which include possibly using a partial dataset if matches cannot be found and not being able to use a longitudinal analysis framework To deal with the strengths and weaknesses of these methods we  use the treatment effects model as our primary method and conduct a sensitivity analysis using a mixed effects regression model adjusting for propensity scores If we lose too many cases due to not enough matches we  perform an additional sensitivity analysis using a treatment effects model with augmented inverse probability weighting This method uses the whole dataset but is not robust to outliers 
Treatment effects models with propensity matching require identifying predictors of treatment to calculate a propensity score Within the treatment effects model framework we  use logistic regression models to predict the propensity for receiving treatment using the following covariates the 

severity of the primary psychiatric diagnosis the number of comorbid conditions overall symptom burden functional impairment age sex social class and insurance status Once propensity scores are calculated treated participants  be matched to untreated participants using matching or n matching if the distribution allows The treatment effect on the outcome  then be analyzed in the matched sample All analyses  be performed using Stata 
Aim II Given that this is a naturalistic study we do not know what the groups  look like but anticipate getting more treated versus untreated participants If the distribution of patient participants allows we  be able to employ n matching However since this is unknown we  compute power based on the assumption of matching Additionally because power analysis methods are not available for this complex model we  estimate using traditional methods for generalized linear models with a binomial distribution and logit link function In we had approximately existing patients in our Behavioral Health Clinics and we receive about new evaluations per year Given our existing pool of patients plus two years of new evaluations to account for study implementation and recruitment we  have about potential participants Assuming a enrollment rate and a dropout rate we anticipate enrolling patient participants and expect to have participants left at the end of the study To make our calculations we need to specify the prevalence of SUD in treated and untreated patients While our study sample  comprise of participants with many different psychopathologies we  base the prevalence of SUD on the subsample of patients with ADHD because the most extensive research has been done on SUD in this population In a prospective study of males with ADHD Biederman et al showed SUD prevalence of in the non medicated ADHD group and in the medicated ADHD group at the four year follow up Similarly in a prospective study of females with ADHD Wilens et al showed SUD prevalence of in the non stimulant therapy group and in the stimulant therapy group at the four year follow up Since the prevalence in the medicated groups differ by about between males and females we  use the rates from Wilens et al in our power calculations to be conservative Assuming SUD prevalence of in the treated group and in the untreated group standard deviation of sample size of per group and alpha to account for the three statistical tests in Aim we  have power to detect an odds ratio OR power to detect an OR where the ORs are the odds of the untreated group developing OUD compared to the treated group 
Aim III Again we  estimate power for this aim using traditional methods for generalized linear models with a binomial distribution and logit link function In we had approximately existing patients in our SUD Treatment Clinics and we receive about new evaluations per year Given our existing pool of patients plus two years of new evaluations to account for study implementation and recruitment we  have about potential participants Assuming a enrollment rate and a dropout rate we anticipate enrolling participants and expect to have participants left at the end of the study The literature on the prevalence of OUD in patients with existing SUD who are being treated for juvenile psychopathology is sparse The prevalence is a key piece of information we need to make power calculations Based on observation of unintentional OD in our own outpatient SUD treatment program when we examined rates of OD in patients years prior to intake and after years of treatment we saw a reduction in rate of OD vs respectively Given that most of the ODs were opioid related we  use this reduction as a proxy for the difference in prevalence of OUD in SUD patients who are and are not being treated for psychopathology In Table in Appendix B we present the minimum detectable effect using a sample size of per group an alpha to account for the two statistical tests in Aim and power of and for various OUD prevalence that differ by in the treated and untreated groups ORs are the odds of the untreated group developing OUD compared to the treated group 
Aim IV Key analyses for this aim involving mediation  all be done fully prospectively i e treatment predictor at T followed by mediator at T and outcome at T The variables whose 
effects are to be mediated  be degree of treatment exposure measured at T The analyses  replicate common practice in mediation mechanisms research The mediational analyses of OUD SUD outcomes  use hierarchical linear modeling HLM covarying for any baseline opioid substance use and prior treatment Each mediator  initially be tested individually by itself The significance of mediation effects  be tested by a product of coefficients test using bootstrapped standard errors Once a proposed mediator such as subjective distress or psychiatric symptom reduction has been established to work in isolation it  be tested in combination with all significant mediators i e multiple mediation model to help determine the relative importance of each mediator in explaining any observed effect of treatment on reducing OUD SUD risks while accounting for all other significant mediators For the moderators demographics psychosocial clinical we  examine the effect of duration and intensity of treatment adding one moderator at a time to the model to test how treatments effects on reducing OUD SUD risks may be potentiated or attenuated by each specific moderator variable For moderation effects we  report statistical significance if present but also effect sizes Where significant moderation is detected follow up analyses  clarify directionality Furthermore we  attempt to unpack significant primary findings to generate concrete applications for use in clinical practice Potential examples include generating specific cut off scores suggesting a patient would particularly benefit or not for a given mechanism sensitivity analyses to determine the duration and or intensity of treatment associated with positive effects and applying evidence based medicine concepts such as of number needed to treat to inform practice and compare with other interventions
Target population distribution 
Projected Cumulative Enrollment 
Efforts  be made to attain a mix of study participants in terms of gender and racial ethnic representation that is reflective of the respective populations under study No restrictions are placed on recruiting related to sex or ethnicity of subjects All subjects regardless of sex race or ethnicity who meet the eligibility requirements  be permitted to enter the study No ethnic or racial group  be excluded from this study We expect the racial ethnic composition of the sample  mirror that of the Boston area We  not exclude subjects on the basis of gender We expect approximately of subjects  be female Approximately to percent of the population belongs to minority ethnic racial groups Although the subsample of minorities  not yield enough statistical power for tests of our hypotheses within minorities we  examine the minority data separately to generate hypotheses for future work 
 Protectionofdataandqualityassurance completeness
Data  be collected by trained research coordinators who have completed on line training in human subjects research HIPAA research integrity training in our lab on research data management and confidentiality and project protocol procedures 
To ensure confidentiality all raw data generated in this study  be filed in special research files one per participant which  be identified only by an ID number that  not identify the participant in any way Any material including the names of participants or other identifying information consent assent forms paper records  be kept in locked filing cabinets in a locked room Documentation linking participant s names and numbers  be kept in a password protected electronic file only accessible by the project coordinator and primary investigators PIs on a password protected computer located behind a secure and maintained firewall 
Digital audio recordings  be transferred to a password protected secure storage drive and the Research Coordinators  remove any identifying information De identified recordings  then be sent for transcription to a HIPAA compliant transcription service Following their transcription voice recordings  be deleted from the audio recorder and storage drive 
Transcripts and behavioral notes from focus groups individual interviews and usability testing  be double checked to ensure that they do not contain any identifying information The notes and transcripts  be stored in a password protected word document on a secure computer server to which access  only be granted to members of the study team If notes are originally written by hand they  be stored in a locked office for a maximum of one week before being transcribed into the word document After transcription handwritten notes  be shredded 
Participants  complete the SAGE SR assessment s on the SAGE SR Web platform either on a tablet in clinic or at home on a personal computer tablet The SAGE SR web platform  process score and generate cross informant comparisons if applicable The SAGE SR Web system meets HIPAA requirements Participant SAGE SR data  be stored securely in the SAGE SR web platform and  be available for export to secure servers on the Partners system 
All other self report questionnaires  be collected and stored electronically using the Research Electronic Data Capture REDCapTM software a free secure HIPAA compliant web based application hosted by the Partners HealthCare Research Computing Enterprise Research Infrastructure & Services ERIS group Using this software we  build an electronic case report form eCRF for this study which  capture all data collected for this 

research study Once built patient participants and study staff can enter data directly into REDCapTM via any computer or tablet with standard web access and browsers 
For in person study visits study staff  set patient participants up on computers or tablets and  open the survey forms in REDCap for them to use Direction  be as clear as on paper and pencil tests If for any reason any part of any visit cannot be completed in person all assessments can be conducted remotely via email and or phone Research assistants  contact participants via preferred contact method text phone email or mail to coordinate the virtual visit Research assistants  send an encrypted email with a link to REDCap surveys to be completed and a link to the SAGE survey s To minimize missing data for self report forms we  program missed question warnings in REDCapTM that  alert participants in real time if they inadvertently skip a question 
The patient reported outcome measure self report questionnaires including the PHQ GAD TAPS and S BI  also be integrated into the electronic medical record for the patient s clinician to view We  train clinic staff on the interpretation of the results of these measures 
Data collected via REDCapTM  be automatically backed up nightly at MGH To ensure data completeness data management staff  run weekly reports that highlight incomplete data Study staff  then be asked to resolve and update data fields flagged by data management staff In this manner the database  be proactively and continuously curated to ensure its completeness and to enable rapid translation into interim reports 
To ensure that REDCap users have access only to data and information that they are supposed to have access to user privileges can be regulated within REDCap specifically for each project For the proposed study we  build distinct profiles that limit access to various functionality and modules such as being able to export data to enter data to add or modify database fields or survey questions to build or run reports to modify user privileges to view the logging records and so on 
For data safety and integrity purposes it is important to note that REDCap maintains a built in audit trail that logs all user activity and all pages viewed by every user Whether the activity be entering data exporting data modifying a field running a report or add modifying a user among a plethora of other activities REDCap logs all actions The logging record can itself be viewed within a project by users that have been given privileges to view the Logging page The Logging page allows such users to view or export the entire audit trail for that project and also to filter the audit trail in various ways based upon the type of activity and or user The built in audit trail in REDCap allows administrators to be able to determine all the activity and all the data viewed or modified by any given user 
Also of note is that all data captured in REDCap for this project  be stored on our own i e Partners Healthcare and BMC respectfully servers No project data is ever transmitted at any time by REDCap from that institution to another institution or organization 
Data  be transmitted only in pooled form and subjects  be identified by ID numbers Any publications of study findings  be reported so that no person can be identified individually These issues  be clearly stated in consent forms and discussed with participants during the informed consent process prior to any study related procedures 
In accordance with the NIH NIDA HEAL Initiative de identified data  be shared with the NIH NIDA in order to create a HEAL Initiative repository Data shared includes the following 
measures collected from consented participants NIDA HEAL substance use measure and NIDA HEAL demographic measure Data managers  provide a de identified data set to NIH NIDA HEAL grant administrators on a quarterly basis or more often if deemed necessary by the research team 
The NIH NIDA  create a closed data repository which  only be made available to members of the HEAL Initiative and those granted access from the NIH NIDA The purpose of the repository is to be able to create a large data set based on harmonized measures throughout the sites involved in the HEAL grant in order to increase power of the data analysis conducted

This is a naturalistic longitudinal study Hence a formal DSMB is not required Importance of Knowledge to be Gained 
Despite the onset of up to three quarters of SUDs in young people and that high rates of SUD are seen in those with behavioral health disorders there is a lack of substance use screening completed in high risk clinics If successful our study  be among the first to implement and systematize the identification of substance use in behavioral health clinics Moreover our study  answer long standing and critical questions for instance does treating psychopathology mitigate the longer term development of OUD nicotine and other SUDs Does treating young people with less severe SUD prevent the onset of OUD and or more severe SUD Moreover we  be able to address the mechanisms of risk reduction 
The study is reasonable to conduct as the risks to the subjects are minimal as detailed above while the benefits in behavioral health and substance use settings are of the highest clinical and public health utility and may result in large benefits to patients families and society 
Emory University and Cherokee Nation Behavioral Health are conducting a cluster randomized trial and  randomize high schools located within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Cherokee Nation in rural northeastern Oklahoma to preventive intervention or delay program control conditions The trial  include survey data from a cohort of approximately to youth ages to followed over three years 
Federally recognized tribes enjoy special protections as domestic dependent sovereignties As such any entity other than the Cherokee Nation including its research intensive partner Emory University or the sponsor of the study wishing to access view or use the data from this study must request explicit permission from the Cherokee Nation prior to data access must agree to abide by all requirements of the Cherokee Nation review process and must comply with any conditions the Cherokee Nation requires for data access or use 
Data collected as part of this trial are particularly sensitive for several reasons The entire trial is conducted collaboratively with the Cherokee Nation and conducted entirely within the territory under the jurisdiction of the Cherokee Nation Thus it  be impossible to share these data without identifying the tribe Second some behaviors the subject of survey items are illegal Third the study communities and their high schools are quite small as a result the deductive identification of individuals by patterns of survey responses might be easily accomplished even with access to a standard dataset cleaned of all obvious identifiers Fourth there is a long history in the U S of mistreatment and harmful non equal collaboration with tribes including by actors in the research community 
The NIH convened a Tribal Collaboration Working Group of the All of Us Research Program Advisory Group https allofus nih gov about who we are tribal collaboration working group all us research program advisory panel The Tribal Collaboration Working Group TCWG completed a report that identifies strategies for developing meaningful culturally sensitive collaborations with AI AN populations https allofus nih gov sites default files tribal collab work group rept pdf Relevant highlights directly quoted from the report include 
Tribal sovereignty ensures that any decisions regarding tribal members and tribal property are made with their participation and consent p This sovereign status which is a political designation gives tribes legal rights and privileges that are distinct from racial and ethnic groups 
Research partnerships with AI AN populations require unique 
considerations including greater input and oversight by tribal communities on data and biospecimen policies beyond those for other groups p Many tribal nations and individuals are hesitant to participate in biomedical research due to historical transgressions by both the federal government and researchers p 
Some research has stigmatized or harmed AI AN tribes p 
Some researchers have also engaged in practices that violate tribal beliefs p 
The researchers at Emory University in partnership with Cherokee Nation Behavioral Health agree to securely collect and store project data and further agree to share the study data provided all data requests are reviewed and approved by the Cherokee Nation IRB It is the responsibility of any external party requesting access to project data to request in writing to the project PI the specific data requested and to apply to the Cherokee Nation IRB for such access according to procedures promulgated by the Cherokee Nation Further any such access is conditional on meeting all requirements specified by the Cherokee Nation IRB 
Cohort tracking and survey databases  be linked by arbitrarily assigned study numbers not students school ID or other such numbers to ensure identifying information is not contained in the survey databases Survey data collected from study participants  be transmitted immediately via cellular connected tablets using REDCap or Qualtrics to the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health HIPAA secure server REDCap and Qualtrics are secure web applications for building and managing online surveys and databases They are HIPAA compliant and secured Once each wave of data is collected checks  be run for data consistency and quality Processes are in place to generate individual and school de identified databases for analyses Study data  be maintained on an Emory University Rollins School of Public Health HIPAA secure server during and after the active study phase Emory University  not share data without approval from the Cherokee Nation Institutional Review Board Furthermore the Emory researchers agree to submit all presentations and manuscripts to the Cherokee Nation IRB for review and approval prior to public dissemination or publication a requirement that  also apply to any external party requesting data access 
The analysis dataset  include self reported demographic and behavioral data from self reported surveys of study participants including drug use behaviors Because we are following a cohort of youth ages to over three years we  be collecting identifying information for tracking to re survey respondents Even though the final dataset  be stripped of individual and school identifiers prior to release for sharing there remains the reasonable possibility of deductive disclosure of participants with unusual characteristics given the small socially identifiable population under study and small size of the high schools within these low population count rural communities within the jurisdictional territory of the Cherokee Nation Thus we  make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a negotiated data sharing 
agreement that provides for review and approval of the data request and study protocol by the Cherokee Nation IRB a commitment to using the data only for research purposes restrictions against attempting to identify study participants a commitment to securing the data using secure computer technology a commitment to destroying data after the specific requested analyses are completed agreement to submit all presentations and manuscripts to the appropriate tribal authorities for review and approval prior to public dissemination and publication reporting responsibilities to the Cherokee Nation restrictions on redistribution of the data to third parties and proper acknowledgement of the source of the data Any entity other than the Cherokee Nation wishing to access view or use the data from this study must request explicit permission from the Cherokee Nation and must agree to abide by the Cherokee Nation IRB review process and conditions imposed thereby In some instances the Cherokee Nation may require that their communities not be identified this precaution is taken to protect the community from harm which may occur due to careless disclosure of sensitive information about a small socially identifiable population 
The Emory University and Cherokee Nation Behavioral Health team are committed to maximize the availability of publications and the sharing of underlying data from our project Our public access and data sharing plan includes 
Electronic copies of all publications  be deposited within four weeks of acceptance by a journal in PubMed Central 
All publications are planned to be open access and dedicated to the public domain 
All publications  be made publicly available immediately without any embargo period 
Underlying Primary Data for the Publications  be made available to outside individuals via written request from the PI and with approval of a data sharing agreement with the Cherokee Nation as described above Contact information for the PI  be listed on all manuscripts and publications as a means to facilitating access to the data 
To meet program goals under the NIH HEAL Initiative we understand that the NIH requires broad and responsible sharing of Underlying Primary Data from NIH Supported NIH HEAL Initiative Research Projects that protects and maintains the privacy and confidentiality of participant data If the research involves human subjects as defined by R the Public Access and Data Sharing Plan should discuss how the privacy rights of participants and confidentiality of their data  be protected and maintained in accordance with and other applicable laws and regulations 
To meet these requirements survey databases  be linked by arbitrarily assigned study numbers for participants not students school ID or other such numbers and schools to ensure individual and school level identifying information is not contained in the survey databases Race ethnic identifiers  only include broad categories including American Indian ancestry Tribal 
citizenship  not be included in shared data sets to help protect the identity of small populations and samples unless tribal identity is an important aspect of the research the sample size for that particular tribe is large enough to protect individual confidentiality and with the permission of the Cherokee Nation Processes are in place to generate de identified databases for analyses which  not include individual or school level identifiers School cohort sample sizes range from approximately to students Additional demographic and other variables may be omitted for small school samples to protect the possible identification of individuals and schools 
NIH s Certificate of Confidentiality CoC policy automatically issues a CoC for any NIH funded projects using identifiable sensitive information The CoC gives the researchers the authority to not release identifying information even if subpoenaed to do so 
NIH requires that the Applicant should discuss the potential risks to research participants posed by data sharing and steps taken to address those risks 
The study s parent consent and youth assent forms include information regarding the sharing of de identified data 
Some of your information may be placed into public databases for other researchers to use Anything we share would only use a code number instead of your name In addition to not including your name researchers  need to sign data use agreements before using or seeing the data We  remove or code any personal information that could identify you before your information is shared This  ensure that by current scientific standards and known methods it is extremely unlikely that anyone would be able to identify you from the information we share Despite these measures we cannot promise that your answers could not be linked back to you 
The Cherokee Nation and Emory University IRBs have reviewed and approved this Public Access and Data Sharing Plan 
We  abide with the principles of the data and resource policy developed by the HEAL Prevention Initiative Steering Committee consistent with the relevant NIH policies laws and regulations while simultaneously protecting the identity and confidentiality of the study sample and the Cherokee Nation a small socially identifiable population Federally recognized tribes enjoy special protections as domestic dependent sovereignties As such any entity other than the Cherokee Nation wishing to access view or use the data from this study  need to request explicit permission from the Cherokee Nation and must agree to abide by the procedures and requirements of the Cherokee Nation IRB review process
RESOURCE SHARING PLAN 

For the proposed R project Data Sharing  be consistent with the practices used by Dr Carroll s research and data management team in other trials For all projects anonymized data sets are developed for sharing with other investigators within and outside Yale to support meta analysis and secondary analysis projects 

In general one master data file is created for each study that includes all variables necessary to address the primary study aims and hypotheses The master data set following the guidelines of the Data Analysis Plan is fast tracked for data cleaning and locking Detailed codebooks are prepared describing variable names and descriptions and specifications for each form In compliance with HIPAA the master data set does not include any personally identifiable information Once the primary data set is created case report forms collected for secondary analyses are then cleaned and prepared for use and archiving Final master data sets include for each study demographic and baseline information on drug use and related problems ASI data information on treatment compliance and outcome treatment fidelity data where appropriate as well as substance use outcomes from urinalyses and self report 

All data are de identified before sharing using procedures that are in compliance with HIPPA and Yale Human Investigation Committee standards No datasets contain subject names addresses or other specific personal identification

The Data Coordinating Center  adhere to the policies of the NICHD and the NICHD Data and Specimen Hub DASH as well as the repository for the NIH Helping to End Addiction Long term HEAL Initiative to make data available to other scientific investigators All of our current studies are designed and implemented with the expectation that the data  be shared with DASH and other NIH repositories as applicable Our consent forms state that the data  be included in a repository in a de identified format that outside investigators may access 
An overview of the process is shown in the figure below and described in detail in the subsequent sections 
Dataset Creation availability of dataset to outside researchers 
Plans for data sharing begin at the start of the study when a template program is set up that combines the variables from different forms to create one augmented dataset that includes derived variables for analysis based on the statistical analysis plan One of the early tasks is to adapt the template into a BUILD dataset with accompanying documentation which then becomes the foundation for analysis regular reporting and finally the primary and secondary outcomes of the study The BUILD dataset contains all of the variables from the data forms This comprehensive program and dataset is known as the in house BUILD The next step is to ensure that the in house BUILD is complete and correct The study team then 
Verifies that variable labels are complete 
Merges in variables from primary secondary analysis programs if not already present 
Drops system variables of no importance for analysis e g identification number of person completing form Double checks results in published papers are consistent and correct
The Release dataset i e the dataset that  be released to DASH is a modified version of the in house 
BUILD 
De identification Procedures 
All study patients have a unique numeric identifier Network Number including center subsite if applicable with possibly some additional descriptors To de identify the Release dataset this patient identifier is removed completely so that records cannot be linked back to identifiable information even at the clinical site where the patient was enrolled Thus enrollment location is not available In addition the records are randomized out of the usual sequential order so that no inference can be made about subject characteristics based on the order of the subjects in the dataset In the Release dataset subjects are identified by a new ID number which is based on the randomized order For datasets where multifetal pregnancies are included there is a separate record for each fetus infant with birth order identifying each fetus infant 
Dates are usually the only HIPAA identifiers collected for any of our studies All dates are replaced by the number of days since a random confidential usually patient specific reference date for example enrollment date The actual dates chosen depend on the design of the study and are not released outside of the data coordinating center 
Variables with low frequencies have the potential to threaten the patient privacy 
Categorical variables or variables with a limited number of individual responses and with frequencies 
less than for some values could have the potential to identify individual participants Such variables are recoded and grouped into categories for example age of mother below and above or racial ethnic groups with low frequencies 
Alternatively derived variables are created for example rather than a yes no variable for each of a list of diseases that are rare in the population being studied the diseases are grouped into logical set s of diseases and a derived variable created which assigns Yes if any of the diseases are present and No otherwise In these cases the original variables are dropped from the dataset 
Variables with < responses may be removed from the Release dataset An exception may occur if the variable has been created from information only available within the study such as adjudication of outcomes or neurodevelopmental tests that were not part of clinical care as such data would not appear in a patient s medical record 
Documentation 
User friendly documentation is created on a single spreadsheet This compact layout allows the user to determine where the variable came from whether it was recoded and how what type of variable it is such as baseline study visit maternal outcome the SAS format the label name and the manual of operations definition 
We have programs that automate creation of the metadata and documentation in user friendly worksheets which  enable variable searching and easy creation of data subsets for specific analyses for the users 
Data Submission to DASH 
The items that  be provided to DASH for the users  include 
Data Forms with variable names 
Protocol of the study 
Codebook data dictionary 
The dataset itself in both SAS and CSV 
DASH has an upload tool and workspace to facilitate the data and metadata upload After review the submission  either be accepted or sent back for modification and resubmission 
Post DASH 
Following the successful submission to DASH a webinar  be held in which the lead investigator  briefly describe the study design and results and DCC personnel  detail the information available in DASH The webinar  be advertised through MFM Division directors and or the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine SMFM to introduce interested researchers to the data that are available in DASH

Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH to protect the confidentiality of our participants Equipment used to record the intervention sessions  be approved as necessary by local sites and potential participants  be asked to explicitly consent to having an audio recording of the session These recordings  not be labelled with any study related information i e study name study ID number Recordings  be edited to remove anything that could potentially identify participants such as specific dates names or places Participants may still participate if they choose not to consent to the audio recording 

The program sessions  take place by telephone or video chat Participants may choose the video chat platform most convenient for them e g Zoom BlueJeans FaceTime or Skype for Business for condition sessions however HIPAA compliant platforms e g Zoom  be recommended and encouraged Study cell phones used to communicate with participants and complete therapy sessions  have strong password protection and Intelligent Hub Mobile Device Management System protection which is required of all mobile devices accessing the U M network Intelligent Hub enables safeguards against data compromise malware and ransomware and has a user portal to manage devices in case of theft loss or forgotten passwords Although every reasonable effort  be taken confidentiality during actual phone web based or video chat communication procedures cannot be guaranteed 

During this study the major potential risk to study participants is violation of confidentiality of qualitative interview and assessment data The risk of violation of confidentiality exists because participants  be disclosing personal information in assessments and intervention sessions This risk is related to the damage that could be caused by an inadvertent release of sensitive information e g substance use medical conditions Participants  be informed of the procedures taken to protect their confidentiality There is also a slight risk of psychological discomfort to study participants as a result of being asked personal questions on sensitive topics Participants may also become anxious or upset during discussions of their thoughts about managing their pain or substance use during the condition sessions and or the assessments Study staff  be trained to respond to this emotional distress and to refer participants to appropriate resources as necessary All participants  be free to terminate the assessments at any time or refuse to respond to any questionnaire item All information collected is for research purposes only and data  be kept in strict confidence Under the st Century Cures Act this study  be covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality from NIH Drs Ilgen and Lin  ensure that all relevant IRBMED policies procedures and stipulations are being followed They  also  be responsible for ensuring that other investigators and project staff adhere to the UM IRBMED policies including All participants  understand agree to and provide informed consent before participating strict adherence to a participant s right to withdraw or refuse to answer questions  be maintained all interviews and assessments  be confidential and no names  be associated with the interview data consent forms and identifying information  be kept separate from the actual participant data all identifying information consents tracking data  be kept locked in a filing cabinet at all times and computer files  be saved with passwords and participants  be informed in the consent form how to contact the PI the project managers and the IRBMED office with any questions and or concerns Drs Ilgen and Lin  be responsible for communicating with the IRB the sponsor or other regulatory agencies in the event of a breach of confidentiality according to the specified guidelines 

Adverse Event reports to the IRB NCCIH representatives and the IMC  be the responsibility of the PIs AE reports and annual summaries  not include subject or group identifiable material Each report  only include the participant study identification number If treatment condition is a necessary requirement of AE reporting treatment conditions  be masked unless unmasking is requested by the IMC 
Participant risk either excepted or unforeseen is always possible in intervention research For this study the following expected risks may occur 
Psychological Risks 
There is a slight risk of psychological discomfort to study participants as a result of being asked personal questions on sensitive topics Given the characteristics of the study population we anticipate that there  be several triggers that  dictate when action is required These may include the participant s expression of severe distress suicidal or homicidal ideation increased or problematic substance use and or other serious psychiatric or medical symptoms 
Participants may also become anxious or upset during discussions of their thoughts about managing their pain or substance use during the intervention sessions and or the assessments To minimize this risk research assistants  be trained to respond to this emotional distress and to refer participants to appropriate resources as necessary Specifically this training  include information regarding evaluating warning signs of distress that could occur as a result of the screening intervention or assessments and means of addressing such issues and minimizing distress Such strategies  include maintaining an empathic response acknowledging the distress through reflection avoiding blame processing in a non blaming non confrontational manner and eliciting or encouraging use of relaxation and cognitive calming strategies 
There is a small risk that the PPMI or EUC conditions might upset participants The EUC sessions  focus on providing beneficial educational materials and participants may express any distressing thoughts or emotions these materials may produce The components of PPMI are based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and are non confrontational and include therapist empathy respect and a problem focused orientation It has been our experience that this approach drastically diminishes risks to participants from the study s interventions 
There is a minor potential risk to confidentiality of assessment data urine drug screen results video chat and audio recorded sessions The risk of a violation of confidentiality exists because human participants  be disclosing personal information both in assessments and condition sessions This risk is related to the damage that could be caused by an inadvertent release of sensitive information e g psychiatric symptoms substance use etc Limits to confidentiality  be disclosed to the participants during the informed consent process and participants  be reminded of these limits at each study assessment Participants  be reminded of the voluntary nature of the project and that they may terminate the assessments at any time or refuse to respond to any questionnaire item or discuss any topic Participants  be asked to explicitly consent to having audio recordings of the sessions Participants may still participate if they choose not to consent to the audio recording or to provide a urine sample for the drug screen 
Social Economic risks 
There is a low risk regarding breach of confidentiality which may result in economic or social repercussions distress or embarrassment Data security protections are in place to prevent these potential breaches 
Legal risks 
Due to the nature of the study and the population data  be gathered from participants regarding the use of alcohol and other drugs and other activities which may be illegal There is a low risk regarding a breach of confidentiality regarding these issues including results of urine drugs screens Information collected during the conduct of the study  not be shared with any outside entity including law enforcement In addition this study  have a Certificate of Confidentiality which  prohibit the disclosure of identifiable sensitive research information to anyone not connected with the research except when informed consent is obtained from the participant Information regarding the Certificate  be included in the informed consent document and  outline that the research staff  not 
Disclose or provide in any Federal State or local civil criminal administrative legislative or other proceeding the name of such individual or any such information document or biospecimen that contains identifiable sensitive information about the individual and that was created or compiled for purposes of the research unless such disclosure or use is made with the consent of the individual to whom the information document or biospecimen pertains or
Disclose or provide to any other person not connected with the research the name of such an individual or any information document or biospecimen that contains identifiable sensitive information about such an individual and that was created or compiled for purposes of the research 
In addition it  be disclosed to participants during the informed consent process that disclosure of protected information is permitted only when 
Required by Federal State or local laws e g as required by the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act or state laws requiring the reporting of communicable diseases to State and local health departments excluding instances of disclosure in any Federal State or local civil criminal administrative legislative or other proceeding 
Necessary for the medical treatment of the individual to whom the information document or biospecimen pertains and made with the consent of such individual 
Made with the consent of the individual to whom the information document or biospecimen pertains or
Made for the purposes of other scientific research that is in compliance with applicable Federal regulations governing the protection of human subjects in research 
The risks outlined above are considered to be minimal in severity and  likely occur infrequently Each expected risk  be identified and addressed in the protocol and consent form Assessment of risks  be conducted at each study assessment visit to ensure adequate monitoring of each participant throughout the study Predetermined cutoffs for identifying risks and necessary appropriate actions to mitigate these risks are provided in the study protocol see Section Safety Assessments Once a participant has completed all study requirements research staff  have no further contact with participants unless they provide consent to be contacted for future research studies Adverse events or unexpected outcomes e g participant hospitalization or deaths  not be monitored or reported once a participant has completed the final study visit 
During the conduct of clinical research with human participants especially those who use substances there is always the potential that an unexpected risk or emergency situation  arise The general categories of emergency situations that might arise during the conduct of this study include suicidal participants dangerous disruptive participants participants who are acutely intoxicated or experiencing active psychoses participants who express intention to do harm to others and participants misusing opioids or other substances Guidelines have been developed for each of these potential situations and are designed to support project staff members in the identification assessment and management of participants who are in need of crisis intervention due to these emergency situations Specifically these policies and procedures are designed to assist project staff members with identifying and contacting the health care agencies resources that are the most appropriate for providing crisis or emergency services in specific instances In all emergency situations study staff members  remain calm utilize active listening and carefully document what transpires with the participant Staff  refer to the specific assessment procedures and contact project managers and principal investigators as needed so that they can assist in the management of the emergency situation Crisis procedures effective in previous projects conducted by the study investigators  also be utilized including immediately paging Dr Ilgen or Dr Lin for consultation If any research staff observes any indication of potential distress including through review of responses to the assessments further evaluation of the participant  be conducted by a licensed clinician All participants of course are free to terminate the interview at any time or refuse to respond to any question As with any research project unexpected events are always possible 
If risk of suicide is determined to be present we  implement our standard clinical protocol for responding to suicide risk We anticipate participants may endorse current suicidal thoughts or recent suicidal behaviors These symptoms may be indicated by a endorsement of recent suicidal thoughts plans or actions during the interview or assessment or b endorsement of thoughts of suicide or suicidal behaviors during the condition sessions For those who report suicidal ideation determination of high risk for suicidality  be based on a combination of the information verbally gathered during the assessments or condition sessions and the interaction between the research personnel and the participant All research staff  be trained extensively to respond to emotional distress and to discuss concerns and issues should they arise All staff  be trained in the study specific risk management protocol which  resemble a modified version of the VA DOD Clinical Practice Guideline for Assessment and Management of Patients at Risk for Suicide Figure More specifically study staff  be trained to perform attentive and empathic listening as well as exhibit calmness during the interview If the participant articulates thoughts of death or suicidal ideation the research team member  ask the participant to elaborate on recent suicidal thoughts behavior if the patient has not already provided adequate information to judge risk level The level of risk  be based on the participant s responses and whether the research team member perceives that the patient is in immediate danger e g an active plan with intent to act verbalized Any determination of risk level must be confirmed by the clinical staff member on call Study personnel  follow established safety and risk assessment protocols and contact local licensed clinical staff when appropriate Participants who are determined to be at an elevated risk for suicide  be supported in a variety of ways depending on the participant s need including but not limited to referred to their treatment provider directly connecting suicidal participants to the hour suicide crisis hotline proper authority or emergency psychiatric services or arranging with local psychiatry crisis management staff to assess and potentially hospitalize the patient as necessary according to the study protocol Ongoing follow up  occur until it is determined that risk is minimal Thorough documentation of the situation and actions taken by research staff or other applicable treatment providers involved  be submitted for review by the research staff member to the project manager and PIs Below is a graphic representation of the study team s standard suicide risk assessment protocol which has been modified for use for this study 
If a participant arrive to study visits clearly under the influence of alcohol or other substances the participant  be evaluated by the research staff using the approved Intoxicated Participants Flowchart Figure in order to determine whether or not the participant is capable of continuing with the study visit If the research staff deems the participant is not able to continue the visit  be rescheduled and the participant  be provided with the necessary resources to remain safe Similarly participants who present to study visits experiencing active suicidal or homicidal ideation or behaviors acute psychosis or emergent medical issues e g active acute withdrawal  be evaluated by research staff If necessary due to the severity of the concern the appointment  be rescheduled for a later date and the research staff  assist the participant in accessing necessary clinical care

Sharing of data generated by this project is essential to our proposed activities Broadly our intent is to make data and results available to the community of scientists interested in cLBP and VR analgesia for pain in order to confirm and expand current research findings foster further research and avoid unintentional duplication of research 
Reflective of the NIH HEAL Initiative s mandate to disseminate new findings enhances reproducibility and accelerate the ability of researchers to build upon NIH research our data sharing plan makes underlying primary data widely and freely available via the Data Integration Algorithm Development and Operations Management Center DAC While we work with the BACPAC Data sharing Management and Standards working group to finalize procedures in this area the aim of our data sharing plan remains to align with DAC in the following areas 
In any publications and presentations that we author or co author about these data we  identify the repositories where data  be available and describe how to access the data Further we  acknowledge the repository and funding source in any publications and presentations Electronic copies of publications  be deposited within four weeks of acceptance by a journal in PubMed Central with proper metadata to be made discoverable and accessible upon publication To the extent feasible underlying primary data  be shared simultaneously with the publication and made immediately accessible through release under the Creative Commons public domain tool 
Due to potential risks to research participants posed by data sharing we  de identify any primary data shared outside DAC according to the standards set forth in the Department of Health and Human Services Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects and HIPAA to ensure that the identities of research subjects cannot be readily ascertained with from the data 
Stanford University maintains a high community standard for the free release of data and materials Stanford understands and agrees to comply with the NIH policy on Sharing Research Data and on Sharing Model Organisms as outlined in the NIH Guide February and May 
Data Sharing Plan 
Dr Simons and collaborators acknowledge their ingness to share data and materials with other eligible investigators through academically established means Data  be shared with collaborators as soon as available with local colleagues at seminars and talks and with the scientific community at large by posters and presentations at local regional national and international scientific meetings Finally data  be presented via publication to the widest audience possible Press interviews on important publications are arranged through Stanford Media Relations 
Resource Sharing Plan 
Scientific resources produced in the course of this work are valuable for the scientific community They  be shared with collaborators as soon as they are available  be provided to other scientists before publication if the work to be done is different from our purposes and  be provided to the scientific community upon request when findings have been published Transfer of resources is subject to the acceptance of a Materials Transfer Agreements as required by policy at Stanford 
Analyses of data generated from this project  be shared with the scientific community through publications in peer reviewed journals and presentations at scientific meetings The proposed research  include data from approximately individuals in methadone maintenance treatment The final dataset  include self reported demographic and behavioral data from interviews with the subjects and laboratory data from urine specimens provided Because we  be following study participants we  be collecting identifying information Even though the final dataset  be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing we believe that there remains the possibility of deductive disclosure of participants with unusual characteristics Thus we  make the data and associated documentation available to research community scientists only under a data sharing agreement that provides for a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology and a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed 
The PI intends to join and cooperate with a future collaborative consortium of awardees to maximize data sharing opportunities including collection curation analysis and sharing The PI  have primary responsibility for resource sharing and dissemination Resources are posted to publicly available sites and thus all persons who  have access to the resources We  follow recent recommendations for best practices for sharing electrophysiological data [Chen et al ] and the FAIR data principles Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable 

We  share all materials resulting from the proposed aims including model code parameters and the results of model based analysis and simulation data from behavioral testing including stimulation parameters recordings of paw withdrawal thresholds and tracking data of animal position within the conditioned place preference box data from electrophysiological testing including stimulation parameters recordings of neural responses to mechanical inputs and recordings of neural responses during different temporal patterns of SCS 

Aim We  deposit all elements required for reproduction of simulations workflow parameter settings random number seeds make files and code into The Open Science Framework 
We  deposit neural models with appropriate documentation to the NEURON Model DB We expect to share these resources and models following acceptance of a peer reviewed manuscript describing the methods and results of our model based design and analysis likely toward the end of the second year of the grant 

Our biophysical based network model of the effects of SCS on wide dynamic range neural activity {Zhang et al ] is already available on the NEURON Model DB 


Aims and We  deposit all experimental protocols with detailed descriptions of methods to prtocols io We  deposit all data from behavioral and electrophysiological testing on black We are currently using blackfynn to host data for sharing under our NIH SPARC OT award and this is a suitable host for the data that  emerge from our proposed experiments We expect to share these data following acceptance of a peer reviewed manuscript describing the results of our behavioral and electrophysiological experiments likely at the end of the third year of the grant
